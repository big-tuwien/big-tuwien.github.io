abstract: Although NFC technology for contactless chip cards (ISO/IEC 14443) is known
  for over ten years now, the market penetration of mobile phones and payment terminals
  integrating NFC is rather rare. From a technical point of view, there are no issues
  that prevent services that are based on NFC from being rolled out. The critical
  part is to put all the necessary players in place and form an interoperable ecosystem
  that allows all stakeholders to participate. In this paper we describe a system
  and the necessary processes for issuing open loop payment schemas on to mobile phones
  for the existing players. The focus of the concept is the implementation of a technically
  and commercially feasible system with minimal impact on the existing infrastructure.
  Hence the integration costs of taking part in the NFC ecosystem are lowered and
  therefore more attractive. During the analysis a finding was, there is no model
  for all markets/countries.
