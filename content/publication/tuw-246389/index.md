abstract: This work describes the design of a smartphone-based game that aims to increase
  children's outdoor activity through location-based interactions. In the game, players
  have to physically go outside, find real trees, and interact with them using their
  smartphones in order to keep the game's character (a timber worm) alive. First evaluation
  results show that children enjoyed playing and increased their outdoor activity.
