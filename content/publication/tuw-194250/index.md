abstract: 'Nowadays, clinical studies are often performed with the help of paper based
  diaries which are kept by the patient or paper based forms which are completed by
  the physician during the patient interview. When using a paper based form for data
  collection there are several main problems [1, 2]: Errors when transcribing; Inability
  to validate the input data; Loss of recorded data due to loss or damaging of the
  physical medium (e.g. a sheet or diary). Personal Digital Assistant (PDA) based
  applications for medical care speed up the collection of data at the point of care
  and ensure data quality and consistency [2, 3, 4, 5]. We developed a PDA based system
  for collecting data at the point of care. For supporting different kinds of studies,
  we allow the interface to be generated dynamically based on the requirements of
  each study. The collected data is then synchronized onto a central server with suitable
  backup strategies to prevent loss of data.'
