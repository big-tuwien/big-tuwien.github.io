Several kinds of dedicated model transformation languages have emerged during the last years, which allow specifying and executing transformations between source and target metamodels and their corresponding models, respectively. However, none of these languages, not even the QVT-standard proposed by the OMG, became generally accepted as a state-of-the-art technology for model transformations. This rare adoption of model transformation languages in practice is due to several reasons. First, existing model transformation languages do not provide appropriate abstraction mechanisms to deal with the complexity of structural heterogeneities of different metamodels. Second, they lack suitable reuse mechanisms in order to reduce the high and error-prone effort of specifying recurring transformations. And finally, these languages exhibit an inherent impedance mismatch between the specification and the execution of model transformations in terms of a one-to-many derivation of concepts, thus hampering both, understandability and debuggability. The aim of this project is to establish a framework called TROPIC (Transformations on Petri Nets in Color) for developing model transformations which tackles these limitations. First, TROPIC allows to specify model transformations on different abstraction levels, providing both a declarative mapping language based on UML 2 component diagrams which hides implementation details, and derived from that, an executable transformation language using Coloured Petri Nets. Second, TROPIC facilitates reusability by providing an initial library of generic transformation operators which can be bound to arbitrary metamodels and by allowing to extend this library on demand with new, user-defined, transformation operators, optionally composed out of already existing ones. Finally, TROPIC overcomes the impedance mismatch by supporting a dedicated runtime model in terms of Coloured Petri Nets, allowing for a homogeneous representation of all transformation artefacts (i.e., models, metamodels and the transformation logic itself), which fosters understandability and debuggability of model transformations. The methodology for evaluating the proposed framework builds on three major pillars. First, appropriate case studies for transforming heterogeneous structural as well as behavioural models will be set up and implemented with different existing model transformation languages, including TROPIC, the results being evaluated on basis of a suitable subset of the ISO 9126 software quality model. Second, the findings of these case studies will be further critically reflected by conducting an empirical study with students from our model engineering courses (around 200 master students every year). Third, dedicated workshops will be held together with internationally renowned inventors of other model transformation languages to additionally review the value of our proposed framework.\nMore information: http://www.modeltransformation.net/\nTerm 01.03.2009 - 31.08.2012\nFunding Austrian Science Fund (FWF) under grant P21374-N13\nPartner University of Aarhus, DänemarkDarmstadt University of Technology, DeutschlandJohannes Kepler Universität Linz, ÖsterreichUniversité de Nantes, Frankreich","date":1589891932,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891932,"objectID":"4829cc4896d4eab9d2f30c38024c2c14","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/project/archive/a-framework-for-model-transformations-on-petri-nets-in-color/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:52Z","relpermalink":"/project/archive/a-framework-for-model-transformations-on-petri-nets-in-color/","section":"project","summary":"Topic Model transformations play an important role in software engineering in general and in the area of model-driven engineering in particular, representing the key mechanisms for model translations (e.g., translating an ER model into a UML class model), model augmentations (e.","tags":["Finished"],"title":"A Framework for Model Transformations on Petri Nets in Color","type":"project"},{"authors":["Petra Kaufmann","Gertrude Kappel"],"categories":[],"content":"Topic With the number of vehicles, both private and commercial, in urban areas steadily increasing, accurate traffic information becomes an increasingly important commodity A change in transport policy, e.g., increased use of public transport and efficient inter-modal transport, will only have a medium to long-term effect on improving the traffic situations in inner-city areas. To create high-quality content for traffic management applications and mobility services, reliable and inexpensive real-time traffic is essential. The TRACK\u0026amp;TRADE project relies on floating car data (FCD) to solve a number of well-known problems generating traffic content. While conventional traffic data collection systems have a high infrastructure maintenance and communication expense, exploits the FCD approach synergies with existing GPS-based fleet disposition systems. The scope of the project is to develop an FCD data mart that allows for the collection and integration of FCD data from as many data suppliers as possible. In turn, the data mart will supply aggregated datasets as well as valued-added services. Services include the provision of maps visually illustrating travel times and the provision of current and predicted travel times for parts of the road network. These services will be provided using XML and Web services and should simplify the creation of more complex services such routing and navigation as well as traffic forecasts. Trading FCD data and the provision of related services would serve two main purposes. (i) It creates an additional income stream for the data producers from an otherwise worthless resource and (ii) given that such data becomes generally available, it allows for the provision of improved traffic information services through a series of more or less technological means. With an increasing number of commercial vehicles (e.g., taxi fleets) being equipped with GPS, a successful business case for the FCD technology can be demonstrated.\nMore information: http://www.trackandtrade.org\nTerm 01.10.2006 - 30.09.2008\nPartner Research Academic Computer Technology InstituteTalent S.

Second, apart of these frameworks, first isolated approaches for the phase of test source model generation have been proposed, which, however, rely mostly on black-box testing techniques, thus, incorporating the source metamodels and the requirements, but neglect the transformation definition, which may lead to untested parts of the transformation definition. Finally, means for fault localization are missing, since testing approaches identify the failing of a test case, but miss to provide the failing parts of the transformation definition.\nFor tackling these limitations, the aim of this project is to establish a comprehensive testing framework for model transformations called TETRABox (A Generic White-Box TEsting Framework for Model TRAnsformations), whereby we base on the experiences gained in our previous FWF-funded project TROPIC. TETRABox supports all testing phases, ranging from test source model generation to fault localization especially focusing on configurable components. To keep the framework broadly applicable, the envisioned components for testing are independent of a transformation language, allowing new languages to be incorporated by providing a transformation to the common formalism of a control flow graph. Second, to leverage white-box testing, TETRABox allows the automatic generation of test source models on basis of the transformation definition by means of symbolic execution. Finally, for fault localization, oracles offering a dedicated failure trace are employed, which are used to provide an entry point for debugging by slicing techniques.\nThe methodology for evaluating the TETRABox framework builds on three major pillars. First, transformations of the ATL model transformation zoo will be systematically tested by means of mutation testing and the results will be compared to existing testing techniques. Second, an empirical study with students from our model engineering courses (around 200 master students every year) will be conducted, whereby errors will be seeded into existing transformations, and the students will have to spot these errors with and without the help of the TETRABox framework. Finally, dedicated workshops will be held with (inter-)national partners.\nMore information here: http://modeltransformation.net/tetrabox/\nTerm 01.08.2016 - 28.02.2019\nFunding Austrian Science Fund (FWF), grant number P28519-N31\n","date":1589891931,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891931,"objectID":"63cc1ba4a704f7706bc5a3bd9530dc79","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/project/archive/a-generic-white-box-testing-framework-for-model-transformations/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:51Z","relpermalink":"/project/archive/a-generic-white-box-testing-framework-for-model-transformations/","section":"project","summary":"Topic Model transformations are crucial for the success of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), comparable in role and importance to compilers for programming languages, allowing to transform models between languages and abstraction levels, e.","tags":["Finished"],"title":"A Generic White-Box Testing Framework for Model Transformations","type":"project"},{"authors":["Manuel Wimmer","Martin Wischenbart","Gertrude Kappel"],"categories":[],"content":"Topic Social networks on the Web have seen enormous growth over the past few years reaching now truly widespread adoption. Since every social network is focused on serving specific human needs, social networkers are present in a number of different networks, leading to scattered social content. This restraint view on social content carries the potential pitfall of untargeted services like indiscriminated product offers of service providers, being a major obstacle in generating revenue. This situation is aggravated by the fact that social networkers are particularly reluctant to share social content with service providers – which would be, however, necessary to enable personalization – at least as long as it is obscure and beyond their control, if and how their social content is being exploited. The main goal of our research project TheHiddenU – A Social Nexus for Privacy-Assured Personalization Brokerage is to exploit the encouraging win-win situation between social networkers and service providers with respect to personalization, by inventing semantic-based mechanisms to leverage techniques for integrating, profiling and privatising social content. The innovative character of TheHiddenU stretches over three unique but highly interwoven research goals. Firstly, TheHiddenU aims at providing a single point of access to social networks in terms of an integrated semantic representation of scattered social content by employing a hybrid integration approach for schema level and instance level. Secondly, TheHiddenU foresees semantic-based profiling mechanisms in order to discover the „hidden“ you and brokerage facilities bringing together social networkers and service providers in a controlled way, thus enabling highly personalized services. Thirdly, TheHiddenU focuses on privacy concerns by providing social networkers with awareness and ample control regarding disclosure and usage of their social content. The solutions for these challenges are realized by means of TheHiddenU prototype and provide the technical prerequisites for a brand new, sustainable business model for the Social Web „personalisation brokerage“. The method for evaluating TheHidden builds on three major pillars, comprising experiments, empirical studies, and a case study, which will be conducted in cooperation with our demonstrators. Thus, TheHiddenU will represent a research test bed as well as an industrial showcase for further commercial exploitation.\nMore information: http://www.social-nexus.net/\nTerm 01.09.2010 - 31.08.2013\nFunding Funded by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Transport, Innovation and Technology (BMVIT) and FFG under grant FIT-IT-825070.\nPartner Johannes Kepler Universität LinzNetural GmbH","date":1589891931,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891931,"objectID":"c301867f80b379d77c5174a3887f8e22","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/project/archive/thehiddenu-a-social-nexus-for-privacy-assured-personalisation-brokerage/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:51Z","relpermalink":"/project/archive/thehiddenu-a-social-nexus-for-privacy-assured-personalisation-brokerage/","section":"project","summary":"Topic Social networks on the Web have seen enormous growth over the past few years reaching now truly widespread adoption.

Über die Cloud werden Rechenkapazität, Datenspeicher, Netzwerkkapazitäten oder auch fertige Software zur Verfügung gestellt. In diesem Projekt adressieren wir die letztere Variante von cloud-basierten Lösungen, welche auch als Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) bekannt ist. In SaaS Lösungen werden Applikationen zentral verwaltet und können von überall aus aufgerufen werden. Die Lösungen bieten eine hohe Verfügbarkeit und automatische, zentrale Sicherung. Der Kunde hat somit immer eine aktuelle Version und kann sich auf das Wesentliche, das Benutzen der Applikation, konzentrieren. Prinzipiell können alle Arten von Software als cloud-basierte Lösung angeboten werden, so auch ERP Systeme. Im Falle von ERP Systemen bedeutet dies, statt eine eigene Instanz der ERP Software an Kunden auszuliefern, wird in der Cloud zentral eine einzelne Instanz des ERP Systems gehostet. Dementsprechend greifen alle Kunden über die Cloud auf diese Instanz zu. Aus diesem Grund ist es von zentraler Bedeutung, dass das ERP System in der Cloud mandantenfähig ist. Ein wesentlicher Aspekt bei ERP Systemen ist die interne Prozessunterstützung und der grundsätzlich brancheneutrale Ansatz. Obwohl auf abstrakter Ebene die Geschäftsprozesse unterschiedlicher Unternehmen sehr ähnlich ablaufen und auf gemeinsamen Kernbausteinen beruhen, sind im Detail die konkreten Ausprägungen von Unternehmen zu Unternehmen sehr unterschiedlich. Daraus folgt, dass eine individuelle und rasche Adaptierung an unterschiedliche Bedürfnisse unterschiedlicher Unternehmen mittels Customizing (Anpassung) zu erfolgen hat. Idealerweise erfolgt diese Anpassung durch Parametrisierung ohne Programmierung. Ziel dieses Projekts ist ein kostengünstiger Ansatz zur unternehmensspezifischen Anpassung eines mandantenfähigen ERP Systems. Die Mandantenfähigkeit stellt in diesem Zusammenhang eine zusätzliche Herausforderung dar, weil zwar für jeden Mandanten individuelle User Interfaces mit individuellen Ausprägungen zur Verfügung gestellt werden, aber alle Mandanten eine gemeinsame Infrastruktur, wie zum Beispiel eine generische Datenbank nutzen sollen. Zum Zweck der unternehmensspezifischen Anpassungen wird ein modellgetriebener Ansatz verfolgt. Das heißt, Standardgeschäftsfälle werden mit Hilfe einer grafischen Modellierungssprache als Referenzmodelle beschrieben. Zudem können mit der grafischen Modellierungssprache unternehmensspezifische Anpassungen der Referenzmodelle vorgenommen werden. Auf Basis dieser Modelle können User Interfaces und Datenbankmappings erzeugt werden. Als Sprache zur Beschreibung der Geschäftsmodelle verwenden wir die REA (Resource-Event-Agent) Ontologie. REA ist eine universelle Sprache, die eindeutige Kommunikation ermöglicht und ein gemeinsames Verständnis für alle am Softwareentwicklungsprozess Beteiligten schafft. Der Projektname REAlist spiegelt einerseits den Bezug zur REA Ontologie wieder und andererseits nimmt er darauf Bezug, dass Auswertungen (Saldenlisten) wie im klassischen ERP erstellt werden können. Wir möchten aber auch betonen, dass wir beim Projekt realistisch bleiben wollen. Es ist klar, dass mit der Anzahl der am Projekt beteiligten Personen innerhalb von 2 Jahren kein ERP System in vollem Funktionalitätsumfang umgesetzt werden kann. Vordergründig geht es im Projekt darum REA Konzepte mittels eines modellgetriebenen Ansatzes auf ein ERP Systems umzulegen und dieses als mandantenfähige SaaS Lösung zu konzipieren.\nTerm 01.09.2013 - 31.08.2015\nFunding Funded by the Österreichische Forschungsförderungsgesellschaft mbH (FFG) under project number 841287.\nPartner   eventus Marketingservice GmbH  ","date":1589891930,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891930,"objectID":"991e654e9d5e49d2395c2dfb196fdba9","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/project/archive/mandantenfhiges-erp-system-in-der-cloud-ein-modellgetriebener-ansatz-auf-basis-der-resource-event-agent-ontologie/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:50Z","relpermalink":"/project/archive/mandantenfhiges-erp-system-in-der-cloud-ein-modellgetriebener-ansatz-auf-basis-der-resource-event-agent-ontologie/","section":"project","summary":"Topic Cloud Computing führte in den letzten fünf Jahren zu einem Paradigmenwechsel in der IT-Branche.

A rich variety of modeling tools is available supporting different tasks, such as model creation, model simulation, model checking, and code generation. Seamless exchange of models among different modeling tools increasingly becomes a crucial prerequisite for effective software development processes. Due to lack of interoperability, however, it is often difficult to use tools in combination, thus the potential of model-driven software development cannot be fully utilized, unless we find some scalable way of integration. We are aiming at providing a semantic infrastructure for model-based tool integration, enabling to facilitate any tool appropriate for the modeling task at hand. The key innovations provided are a set of scalable architectural model integration patterns supported by a high-level metamodel integration language, thus going beyond existing low-level model transformation approaches. Ontology-based metamodel integration considerably lowers the manual effort required for tool integration, enabling a novel synergic use of technologies from the model engineering and ontology engineering domains. An open knowledge base for tool integration captures essential knowledge about modeling languages and tools in terms of ontologies, fostering reuse within and beyond the scope of this project. These innovations will be realized within the ModelCVS prototype and case study. The core of the system will be based on a versioning system such as CVS, thus providing a loosely-coupled and well-proofed integration architecture. Transparent transformation of models between different tools, languages and exchange formats, as well as versioning capabilities exploiting the rich syntax and semantics of models represent the key functionalities of ModelCVS. In this way, ModelCVS will serve as both, a research vehicle and testbed for exploring applications of semantic technologies in model-based tool integration and a prototype for a succeeding industrial product.\nTerm 01.10.2006 - 31.12.2007\nFunding This work has been partly funded by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Transport, Innovation and Technology (BMVIT) and FFG under grant FIT-IT-810806.\nPartner Technische Universität WienJohannes Kepler University LinzArikan Ges.m.b.H.BMLV","date":1589891927,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891927,"objectID":"3ccc958beb02be2481eaf73745e42ec0","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/project/archive/a-semantic-infrastructure-for-model-based-tool-integration/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:47Z","relpermalink":"/project/archive/a-semantic-infrastructure-for-model-based-tool-integration/","section":"project","summary":"Topic With the rise of model-driven software development, more and more development tasks are being performed on models.

Thereby, the integration of domain-specific knowledge into DSMLs can significantly improve the productivity of the development process and the quality of the final system. However, the development of DSMLs has also been recognized as a challenging and significant software engineering task itself.\nIn this project, we focus on the challenges associated with the development of executable DSMLs (xDSMLs) that support the modeling and analysis of complex system behaviors through model execution. In particular, we aim at overcoming the following three challenges: the lack of foundations for formalizing xDSMLs in a way that allows for model-level analyses; the high efforts associated with the development of domain-specific analysis tools for xDSMLs; and the lack of fault localization techniques for efficiently identifying faults in models defined with xDSMLs.\nTo overcome these challenges, the aim of this project is to develop a novel engineering framework for xDSMLs that will provide (i) concepts, techniques and processes to formalize xDSMLs usable for model-level behavior analyses, (ii) automation techniques for efficiently developing domain-specific model analysis tools for xDSMLs, (iii) and fault localization mechanisms for xDSMLs that allow an efficient debugging of models.\nThe framework will be iteratively developed and evaluated. The methodology for evaluating the framework builds on three major pillars, namely case studies, experiments with our master students, and collaborative studies with international collaborators.\nThe results of the project will significantly ease the development of xDSMLs and accompanying model analysis tools, and thus lead to reduced development costs of xDSMLs and at the same time increased quality of systems developed with xDSMLs. This will present a major cornerstone in the model-based development of complex software-intensive systems.\nMore details may be found at http://www.modelexecution.org/lea.\nTerm 01.07.2018 - 28.02.2019\nFunding Funded by the Austrian Science Fund (FWF) under the grant number P 30525-N31.\n","date":1589891926,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891926,"objectID":"f52689c2306cb939abffb03afc09bfd6","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/project/archive/language-engineering-for-analyzable-executable-dsmls/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:46Z","relpermalink":"/project/archive/language-engineering-for-analyzable-executable-dsmls/","section":"project","summary":"Topic The project LEA-xDSML (Language Engineering for Analyzable Executable Domain-Specific Modeling Languages) resides in the context of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE), which proposes the use of domain-specific modeling languages (DSMLs) to reduce the complexity associated with the development of complex software-intensive systems, as, for instance, found in the automation domain, production domain, and automotive domain.","tags":["Finished"],"title":"Language Engineering for Analyzable Executable DSMLs","type":"project"},{"authors":["Manuel Wimmer"],"categories":[],"content":"Topic EU project\nTerm 01.01.2019 - 28.02.2019\nFunding founded by EU, grant number 813884\n","date":1589891926,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891926,"objectID":"e564aee35f3840f8bfae58663d04f48e","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/project/archive/training-the-next-generation-of-experts-in-scalable-low-code-engineering-platforms/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:46Z","relpermalink":"/project/archive/training-the-next-generation-of-experts-in-scalable-low-code-engineering-platforms/","section":"project","summary":"Topic EU project\nTerm 01.01.2019 - 28.02.2019\nFunding founded by EU, grant number 813884","tags":["Finished"],"title":"Training the Next Generation of Experts in Scalable Low-Code Engineering Platforms","type":"project"},{"authors":["Manuel Wimmer","Alexandra Mazak","Tanja Mayerhofer","Bernhard Wally","Christian Huemer","Gertrude Kappel"],"categories":[],"content":"Topic InteGra 4.0 focuses on the horizontal integration throughout value chains as well as on the vertical integration of networked production systems as identified by the German working committee for Industrie 4.0.

By on-the-fly e-business transactions we understand transactions that are conducted between companies, which are not yet in a partnership and dynamically find each other in order to engage in e-business transactions. These business partners have to find each other according to both their business needs and technical capabilities. This is supported by the ERPEL registry. Today, registries are often successfully used within a company, but there are hardly any success stories on public registries to support B2B. One reason is that registry entries may not be considered trustworthy. In order to avoid fake entries, the ERPEL registry will reconcile data with business directories of legal authorities. Furthermore, companies usually do not trust other unknown companies. In order to foster trust in this context we build upon techniques known from social networks. Thereby, we aim at establishing business networks within the ERPEL registry. Finding an appropriate business partner, it is important to know her business capabilities or in other words which products she offers. Usually companies maintain their product portfolio in their ERP system, but hardly anyone is willing to maintain this portfolio in another data store, i.e., the registry. Thus, we develop a seamless integration of the product portfolios, held in the ERP systems of the project partners, into the ERPEL registry. In order to avoid a proliferation of different naming and descriptions of the same products, we apply semantic techniques for product classifications. A search in the registry has to disclose the technical capabilities of a potential business partner in order to ensure interoperability. Overloaded business document standards, missing process choreographies, and a variety of communication protocols hamper an effective search. Thus, ERPEL follows a bottom-up approach starting from core documents with well-defined extension mechanisms, and unambiguous business choreography specifications. Furthermore, ERPEL comes with a default communication protocol specifically targeting SMEs. These unambiguous specifications allow the development of business service interfaces (BSI) that are integrated into the ERP systems. BSIs guarantee the execution of e-business transactions between customers of different ERP systems.\nMore information: ERPEL\nTerm 01.05.2010 - 31.10.2012\nFunding Funded by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Transport, Innovation and Technology (BMVIT) and FFG under grant FIT-IT-825064.\nPartner BMD SystemhausMesonicBlue MonkeysParadigma UnternehmensberatungBOC GroupInfotechnik SmejkalMega Elektro","date":1589891924,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891924,"objectID":"a4381a94a54167c303c479ecb31e5f78","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/project/archive/e-business-registry-permitting-enterprise-liaisons/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:44Z","relpermalink":"/project/archive/e-business-registry-permitting-enterprise-liaisons/","section":"project","summary":"Topic The project ERPEL targets at an e-business registry serving as a backbone for executing on-the-fly e-business transactions between semantically enabled ERP systems.

Integrating business processes into a SOA is certainly a hot topic. However, most current approaches are limited to the technical process aspects, disregarding the economic drivers of the information society. In contrary, BSopt will consider the formalization of the semantics of new business models due to faster changing business environments, their support by appropriate business processes and their implementation in flexible architectures. We will incorporate state-of-the-art approaches to describe business models, business process models and deployment artifacts in SOAs. However, we will go beyond the state-of-the-art by connecting the dots between these approaches allowing for a semi-automatic mapping between them. This will result in an integrated methodology spanning over all layers that is based on a meta model incorporating the semantics of the assimilated approaches. Furthermore, we demonstrate the customization of the BSopt approach by integrating a domain (= industry) specific ontology by means of the print media industry. A critical point in reaching user acceptance is tool support for the BSopt methodology. Following advanced software engineering concepts, we will implement the integrated BSopt approach as a software factory based on a so-called domain specific language (DSL). For this purpose we have to use a meta-modeling tool, that allows us to specify the BSopt meta model within this tool. Furthermore, the software factory will guide a modeler in a wizard-driven style through the BSopt methodology requiring not as much modeling know-how as in traditional modeling languages such as UML. The meta-modeling tools being used in BSopt are the Microsoft DSL tools for Visual Studio and ADONIS. The goal of a software factory-based approach is creating high quality code in shorter time. Code created by the BSopt tools are deployment artifacts (BPEL, WSDL, XAML,etc..) to be consumed by existing software environments ¿ in our case the Oracle SOA Suite and the Microsoft Workflow Foundation. The BSopt approach will be validated by case studies in the print media industry.\nMore information: http://www.bsopt.at/\nTerm 01.04.2008 - 30.09.2010\nFunding Funded by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Transport, Innovation and Technology (BMVIT) and FFG under grant FIT-IT-815124\nPartner Mediaprint Zeitungs- u.

This is also highlighted and reflected by Industrie 4.0, which is seen as the next industrial revolution. As with the previous industrial revolutions, new demands have to be satisfied, e.g., virtually exploring variants, finding optimal solutions, and making dynamic runtime decisions, to allow companies to be more competitive. As a consequence, however, the complexity of CPPS is increasing. To deal with this increased complexity, modeling is a promising approach in this context. However, current modeling foundations and practices are still lacking behind the emerging requirements of Industrie 4.0. First of all, models are still defined and used in isolation within a specific discipline, although it is known that CPPS are inherently multi-disciplinary systems and their optimization has to take this into account. Moreover, models are considered as static entities, mostly used as system blueprints in the early design phases, but they are basically neglected in later lifecycle phases, which drastically limits their value during the systems‘ operation for propagating important runtime information back to engineering.\nThe proposed Christian Doppler Laboratory (CDL) Model-Integrated Smart Production (CDL-MINT) will contribute to the foundations of modeling in general and in particular of modeling smart CPPS. The main goal is to reach a revolutionary new notion of models, so-called liquid models, which implies going from isolated and static descriptions to cooperative and evolutionary prescriptions. By doing so, we stimulate a paradigm shift in modeling knowledge creation, dissemination, and evaluation leading to truly model-integrated smart production.\nThe work of CDL-MINT is divided into two project modules, whereby each will be conducted with one industrial partner. The topics of the two modules are all concerned with model-integrated smart production, thus using the notion of liquid models as a key research driver. Module 2 Cooperative Simulation Megamodels is focusing on the cooperative nature of models by providing schemes for managing related models and their co-simulations in order to optimize production systems. Module 3 Reactive Model Repositories is dealing with the extended usage of models also during operation time by providing a novel kind of model repository which allows for runtime monitoring, model mining, and design model enhancement. By this, both modules contribute to the notion of liquid models by providing (i) cooperation, and (ii) evolution mechanisms for models in general and in particular for the domain of CPPS. Consequently, these modules enable end-to-end integration of engineering which provides end-to-end transparency in real-time.\n More information: https://cdl-mint.big.tuwien.ac.at/\nTerm 01.01.2017 - 28.02.2019\nFunding Christian Doppler Forschungsgesellschaft (CDG)\nPartner Certicon\nLieberLieber\n","date":1589891915,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891915,"objectID":"c6e5b6dcac17089c7afdbacc172c5778","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/project/archive/christian-doppler-laboratory-for-model-integrated-smart-production/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:35Z","relpermalink":"/project/archive/christian-doppler-laboratory-for-model-integrated-smart-production/","section":"project","summary":"Topic Production systems are becoming more and more software-intensive, thus turning into cyber-physical production systems (CPPS).

For realizing the vision of MDE, a bundle of standards for model transformations, model storage, and model exchange has been made available recently, whereas the versioning of models has not gained the necessary attention yet, although being of paramount importance for the success of MDE in practice. Existing VCS in the area of MDE suffer from three main deficiencies comprising erroneous conflict detection, unsupportive conflict resolution and inflexibility with respect to domain-specific modeling languages (DSLs) and associated tools. With AMOR (Adaptable Model Versioning) we propose novel semantic-based methods and techniques to leverage version control in the area of MDE. The innovations of AMOR are manifested in three key research goals. Firstly, AMOR aims at precise conflict detection, i.e. previously undetected as well as wrongly indicated conflicts should be avoided. For this, we incorporate knowledge about the type of modifications the models have undergone and knowledge about the semantics of the modeling concepts used. Secondly, AMOR focuses on an intelligent conflict resolution by providing techniques for the representation of conflicting modifications as well as relieving users from repetitive tasks by suggesting proper resolution strategies. Thirdly, AMOR targets at an adaptable versioning framework, empowering the user to flexibly balance between reasonable adaptation effort and proper versioning support while ensuring generic applicability to various DSLs and associated tools. The solutions to these challenges are realized by means of the AMOR prototype. The method for evaluating AMOR builds on three major pillars, comprising experiments, empirical studies and a case study, integrating AMOR into the commercial UML-tool Enterprise Architect. Thus, AMOR will represent a research test bed as well as an industrial showcase for further commercial exploitation.\nMore information: http://www.modelversioning.org\nTerm 01.02.2009 - 30.09.2011\nFunding Funded by the Austrian Federal Ministry of Transport, Innovation and Technology (BMVIT) and FFG under grant FIT-IT-819584.\nPartner Johannes Kepler Universität LinzSparxSystems Software GmbH","date":1589891914,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891914,"objectID":"aeaa26c469d15ba37be8d04b25966b54","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/project/archive/adaptable-model-versioning/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:34Z","relpermalink":"/project/archive/adaptable-model-versioning/","section":"project","summary":"Topic The development of complex software systems requires appropriate abstraction mechanisms in terms of model-driven engineering techniques (MDE) and proper support for allowing developers to work in parallel in terms of version control systems (VCS).","tags":["Finished"],"title":"Adaptable Model Versioning","type":"project"},{"authors":["Javier Troya","Alexander Bergmayr","Philip Langer","Martin Fleck","Manuel Wimmer","Tanja Mayerhofer","Alexandra Mazak","Patrick Neubauer","David Madner","Gertrude Kappel"],"categories":[],"content":"Topic Successful software has to evolve to keep it compatible and up to date. Up to 90% of software cost is spent on maintenance and of this 75% is spent on the development of new features for staying competitive. The industry progresses through periods of incremental development interlaced with true paradigm shifts. We are currently experiencing one of these paradigm shifts, as remarked by the European Commission: “The speed of change in Internet technologies continues to be impressive. Software is becoming more and more pervasive: it runs on the devices that we use every day …[opening] a new world of possible applications” cf. Cloud computing, Internet of Services and Advanced Software Engineering, European Union, 2011 (doi:10.2759/47598).\nAccordingly, more and more traditional software vendors notice the need to transform their current business and technology model in order to remain competitive. Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) is seen as the most promising way to achieve this change. However, this transition from Software-off-the-shelf (often residing as legacy applications) to SaaS is a tremendous challenge comprising business, application and technical issues. Having an automated, vendor, technology and hardware independent way to migrate an application would permit the software to evolve easily even in case of transition to new paradigms.\nARTIST proposes a software migration approach covering the premigration and postmigration phases. The premigration phase analyzes the technical and non-technical consequences of migrations, supporting the decision-making process on how a migration should be done. The migration phase itself is based on Model Driven Engineering techniques to automate the reverse engineering of the legacy applications to platform independent models. These models are the input for the forward engineering process to generate and deploy modernized applications and to support future migrations. In the postmigration phase, the modernized applications are certified with respect to the stated goals of the premigration phase.\nARTIST will reduce the risk, time and cost of migrating legacy software. It will lower the barriers for companies (with existing software) wanting to take advantage of the latest technologies and business models, particularly when considering the current benefits of Cloud Computing and SaaS.\nMore information: http://www.artist-project.eu\nTerm 01.10.2012 - 30.09.2015\nFunding EU FP-7 project, grant number: 317859.\nPartner ATOS SPAINFUNDACIÓN TECNALIA RESEARCH \u0026amp; INNOVATIONINSTITUT NATIONAL DE RECHERCHE EN INFORMATIQUE ET AUTOMATIQUEFRAUNHOFER-GESELLSCHAFT ZUR FOERDERUNG DER ANGEWANDTEN FORSCHUNG E.VEngineering Ingegneria Informatica SpAInstitute of Communication and Computer SystemsSparxSystems Software GmbHATHENS TECHNOLOGY CENTER SA Spikes NV ","date":1589891914,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891914,"objectID":"df2f4828396c8c1090a55d672ac0c10c","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/project/archive/advanced-software-based-service-provisioning-and-migration-of-legacy-software/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:34Z","relpermalink":"/project/archive/advanced-software-based-service-provisioning-and-migration-of-legacy-software/","section":"project","summary":"Topic Successful software has to evolve to keep it compatible and up to date.

In MDSE, the task of programming, i.e., writing code in a textual programming language, is replaced by modeling in a language such as the Unified Modeling Language (UML). The powerful abstraction mechanisms of models are not only used for documentation purposes, but also for compiling executable code directly out of models. With the rise of MDSE, several problems solved for traditional software engineering became urgent again because well established solutions are not directly transferable from code to models. Among others, the collaborative development of models is currently only limited supported by modeling tools and, consequently, it is mostly a one-(wo)man show. Especially in the field of model versioning, which supports the asynchronous modification of modeling artifacts by multiple developers, only first solutions start to emerge.\nThe urgent need for a suitable infrastructure supporting effective model versioning has been widely recognized by researchers as well as practitioners. Currently, however, there is a lack of empirical studies on the needs of software developers in practice concerning the collaborative development of software systems. The first contribution of this thesis tackles this problem and provides an extensive survey about versioning in practice by the means of an online questionnaire and qualitative expert interviews. One result of the empirical study shows that conflicts due to parallel modifications are considered harmful and, thus, developers try to avoid them. Conflicts, however, should not be seen as negative result of collaboration but as chance for discussing ideas and for improving the system under development. As consequence, the second contribution is a conflict-tolerant model versioning approach, where the developers may commit their changes in the central repository without worrying about possible conflicts. This approach merges two or more parallel versions by applying dedicated merge rules and, by this, it incorporates all modifications of the developers. This builds a good basis for discussing and resolving conflicts collaboratively. Finally, when resolving conflicts a high degree of user interaction is required. When setting models under version control with state-of-the art tools, however, conflicts are hardly accessible for the users. Also the empirical study has shown, that current version control systems lack for a dedicated representation and visualization. Moreover, user support is required to better understand the reasons behind the conflicting changes. The third contribution tackles these deficiencies by visualizing occurred conflicts in terms of model annotations and enriching them automatically with additional meta information to better understand the parallel evolution of the model under development. The implemented prototype is evaluated by means of a quasi-experimental study, which demonstrates the advantages of developing models in a collaborative manner.\nAbstract and paper may be found in our publication database.\n","date":1589891910,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891910,"objectID":"fca776588b17f680ea9a1bf81be16807","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/phd-thesis/archive/conflict-tolerant-model-versioning/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:30Z","relpermalink":"/phd-thesis/archive/conflict-tolerant-model-versioning/","section":"phd-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in December 2011.\nModel-driven software engineering (MDSE), which has recently gained momentum in academia as well as in industry, changed the way in which modern software systems are built.","tags":["Finished"],"title":"Conflict-tolerant Model Versioning","type":"phd-thesis"},{"authors":["Manuel Wimmer"],"categories":[],"content":"This work has been finished in March 2008.\nModel-Driven Engineering (MDE) gains momentum in academia as well as in practice. A wide variety of modeling tools is already available supporting different development tasks and advocating different modeling languages. In order to fully exploit the potential of MDE, modeling tools must work in combination, i.e., a seamless exchange of models between different modeling tools is crucial for MDE. Current best practices to achieve interoperability use model transformation languages to realize necessary mappings between the metamodels defining the modeling languages supported by different tools. However, the development of such mappings is still done in an ad-hoc and implementation-oriented manner which simply does not scale for large integration scenarios. The reason for this is twofold. First, various modeling languages are not based on metamodeling standards but instead define proprietary languages rather focused on notational aspects. And second, existing model transformation languages both do not support expressing mappings on a high-level of abstraction and lack appropriate reuse mechanisms for already existing integration knowledge.\nThis thesis contributes to the above mentioned problems. It proposes a comprehensive approach for realizing model-based tool integration, which is inspired from techniques originating from the field of database integration, but employed in the context of MDE. For tackling the problem of missing metamodel descriptions, a semi-automatic approach for mining metamodels and models from textual language definitions is presented, being a prerequisite for the subsequent steps which are based on metamodels and models, only. For raising the level of abstraction and for ensuring the reuse of mappings between metamodels, a framework is proposed for building, applying, and executing reusable mapping operators. To demonstrate the applicability of the framework, it is applied to the definition of mapping operators which are intended to resolve typical structural heterogeneities occurring between the core concepts of metamodels. Finally, for ensuring roundtrip capabilities of transformations, two approaches are proposed evolving non-roundtripping transformations with roundtrip capabilities.\nAbstract and paper may be found in our publication database.\n","date":1589891910,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891910,"objectID":"83ce192f9cfdc914739d5d39583f3646","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/phd-thesis/archive/from-mining-to-mapping-and-roundtrip-transformations-a-systematic-approach-to-model-based-tool-integration/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:30Z","relpermalink":"/phd-thesis/archive/from-mining-to-mapping-and-roundtrip-transformations-a-systematic-approach-to-model-based-tool-integration/","section":"phd-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in March 2008.\nModel-Driven Engineering (MDE) gains momentum in academia as well as in practice.

The data warehouse’s interaction with the organization and the way it supports the organization’s strategic goals have not yet been considered in depth. Conceptual models that describe the data warehouse from various viewpoints, including an outside view of the data warehouse system, its environment and expected usage, are missing. Moreover, even though the data in the data warehouse by its very nature has to be closely related to the concerns of the organization, current data warehouses also lack sufficient business meta-data that would inform users about the organizational context and implications of what they are analyzing.\nThis thesis targets the relationship between the data warehouse and the structure, behavior, and goals of the organization.\nIn order to describe this relationship, a conceptual modeling language was developed. It consists of models for describing the interdependencies between data warehouses and business processes, including so-called active data warehouse solutions; a model for identifying business objects such as customers and products in the data warehouse data model, and for constructing data models that comply to the state models of such business objects; as well as a model of data warehouse usage, which includes modeling the users, user groups, and user skill levels, the intensity with which they use the data warehouse infrastructure, temporal issues such as the required time and urgency of data access, and indicators of the relative importance of data warehouse usage.\nThis thesis also introduces an approach to using models to enhance the way users access the data in the data warehouse. It presents model-based business metadata, which links enterprise models such as business process models or goal models to the data model of the data warehouse through the mechanism of model weaving.

With its progress, several model transformation approaches and languages have been developed in the past years. Most of these approaches are metamodel-based and, therefore, require knowledge of the abstract syntax of the modeling languages, which in contrast is not necessary for defining domain models using the concrete syntax of the respective languages.\nBased on the by-example paradigm, we propose Model Transformation By-Example (MTBE), to cope with shortcomings of current model transformation approaches. Our approach allows the user to define semantic correspondences between concrete syntax elements with the help of special mapping operators. This is more user-friendly than directly specifying model transformation rules and mappings on the metamodel level. In general, the user’s knowledge about the notation of the modeling language and the meaning of mapping operators is sufficient for the definition of model transformations. The definition of mapping operators is subject to extension, which has been applied for the definition of mapping operators for the structural and the behavioral modeling domain. However, to keep things transparent and user-friendly, only a minimal set of mapping operators has been implemented. To compensate for the additional expressiveness inherent in common model transformation languages we apply reasoning algorithms on the models represented in concrete as well as in abstract syntax and on the metamodels generating adequate transformation code.\nIn order to fulfill the requirements for a user-friendly application of MTBE, proper tool support and methods to guide the mapping and model transformation generation tasks are a must. Hence, a framework for MTBE was designed that builds on state-of-the-art MDE tools on the Eclipse platform, such as the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF), the Graphical Modeling Framework (GMF), the Atlas Transformation Language (ATL), and the Atlas Model Weaver (AMW). The decision to base our implementation on top of Eclipse and further Eclipse projects was driven by the fact, that there is a huge community we can address with our MTBE plug-in.\nFinally, we evaluate our approach by means of two case studies covering the structural as well as behavioral modeling language domain.\n Download the paper\n","date":1589891909,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891909,"objectID":"b1f69a4ee189669e7b43645528379f61","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/phd-thesis/archive/model-transformation-by-example/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:29Z","relpermalink":"/phd-thesis/archive/model-transformation-by-example/","section":"phd-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in May 2008.\nModel-Driven Engineering (MDE) is getting more and more attention as a viable alternative to the traditional code-centric software development paradigm.

Rapid growth of information technologies has brought immense opportunities for patient data sharing, development and dissemination of evidence-based medical knowledge and analysis across distributed, heterogeneous healthcare data sources.\nIn contrast to other industries, where data warehouses have been successfully applied, healthcare is an area in which the information technology had only been able to permeate the administrative and logistic aspects of information processing. The growing need for integrated healthcare has led this industry to open towards adoption of extensive clinical decision support systems.\nEvidence-based medicine (EBM) offers a collection of proven best practise guidelines for recommending drugs and medical treatments. This thesis states that the way data warehouse (DWH) technology can facilitate EBM is twofold: (1) by supporting the rule development process, and (2) by providing the EBM-enriched knowledge base to support the decision-making process of the care givers.\nWith respect to (1), we explain that data warehousing and data mining support the creation of the evidence-based rules by providing a platform and tools for knowledge discovery and pattern recognition. Large amounts of data can be analysed to confirm known or discover unknown trends and correlations in data.\nRegarding (2), we argue that the care giving process can benefit significantly from the application of DWH technology at the point of care.

Ubiquity offers new opportunities and challenges in terms of time-aware, location-aware, device-aware and personalized services. The fundamental objective of ubiquitous web applications is to provide services not only to people at any time, any where, with any media but specifically to communicate the right thing at the right time in the right way. The user should be enabled to interact efficiently with the application despite restrictions in the physical environment, thus preserving semantic equivalence of services and to take advantage from knowledge about the situation of use, leading to semantic enhancement of services. The prerequisite for this is that the application is aware of it`s context. For developing ubiquitous web applications, one must understand what context is to determine its relevancy and how it can be exploited for adapting the provided services towards this context, called customisation. Not least to customisation, the development of ubiquitous web applications is far from easy and calls for appropriate modelling techniques. There exists, however, only a few methods dedicated to the modelling of traditional web applications neglecting to a great extent ubiquity in terms of customisation.\nThis thesis proposes a modelling method for ubiquitous web applications. Customisation is regarded as a new modelling dimension, influencing all other dimensions of ubiquitous web application modelling. As a prerequisite for supporting customisaiton, a set of generic models is introduced comprising a context model and arule model, togehter with several sub models. Generic means that the models provide, in the sense of an object-oriented framework, pre-defined classes and language constructs in order to model customisation. For separation of concerns the application is divided into a stable part, comprising the default, i.e., context-independent structure and behaviour and a variable, context-dependent part, thus being subject to adaptations. A set of generic adaptation operations is provided which can be complemented by application specific ones. These adaptation operations can be integrated into the ubiquitous web application on the basis of adaptation hooks. A customisation toolkit in terms of a customisation rule editor and browser supports an integrated modelling process and facilitates reusability on the basis of a repository of customisation rules, macros and patterns. Finally, a process is introduced, covering the whole task of customisation modelling, with a special focus on reusability, herewith providing a holistic view on the development process of ubiquitous web applications.\n ","date":1589891908,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891908,"objectID":"ba91ad6f20fa04c4027254543dc2ea8a","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/phd-thesis/archive/modelling-ubiquitous-web-applications-requirements-and-concepts/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:28Z","relpermalink":"/phd-thesis/archive/modelling-ubiquitous-web-applications-requirements-and-concepts/","section":"phd-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in November 2001.\nE-commerce and m-commerce have dramatically boosted the demand for services which enable ubiquitous access.

In this respect, customization functionality exploits information on this context of use in order to adapt the application’s services accordingly. In web application development, customization is considered a new dimension which increases complexity by ”crosscutting” the content, hypertext, and presentation levels of a web application. Hence, from a software engineering point of view, a systematic development of UWAs on the basis of models is crucial. In model-driven engineering (MDE), models are employed ”as programs” to (semi-) automatically generate applications, which results in more efficient development processes as well as better maintainability and evolution of software. Customization functionality, however, is typically intermingled with the core functionality in a web application model, having a negative effect on understandability, reuse, maintenance and evolution. The aspect-orientation paradigm provides a new way of modularizing crosscutting concerns such as customization within so-called aspects, as well as the necessary means for composing the previously separated concerns in order to obtain the complete application model. There are already some web modeling approaches dealing with the ubiquitous nature of web applications, amongst them, first proposals to use aspect-orientation. Nevertheless, these approaches suffer from the following problems: First, they don’t consider the crosscutting nature of customization comprehensively, but for the hypertext level, only. Second, just very basic aspect-oriented modeling (AOM) concepts are used, resulting in less powerful mechanisms for separating customization. Third, composition of concerns is not regarded for the modeling level. And fourth, model-driven development of UWAs in the sense of MDE is still limited due to missing metamodel specifications and lack of tool support.\nThe overall aim of this thesis is the exhaustive use of aspect-orientation as driving paradigm for comprehensively modeling customization aspect separately from all web application levels as well as providing means for composing the aspect with the web application model. Therefore, this thesis proposes the aspectUWA approach, which suggests a generic framework for extending existing web modeling languages with AOM concepts within the realms of MDE. In the context of this thesis, aspectUWA is applied to the web modeling anguageWebML, which doesn’t allow to separately model customization. The major contributions of this thesis are as follows: (i) A Conceptual Reference Model (CRM) for AOM has been developed to form the aforementioned general framework. (ii) A metamodel for WebML has been semi-automatically generated from an existing DTD-based language specification in order to allow for MDE.

The major vision is a shift from the idea of “everything is an object” in the object-oriented paradigm to the idea of “everything is a model” in MDE. Following this vision, it becomes obvious that transformations between models play a key role. Just like any other software, transformations should be engineered using sound and robust engineering techniques. However, current engineering techniques focus on the implementation phase of transformations, but fail to provide means for the analysis, design, testing and debugging phases.\nIn particular, to support the analysis and design phase, means are needed that allow to formally describe the requirements of a certain transformation in order to allow for automatic validation in the testing phase. In case of a failure, additional means are needed to efficiently debug model transformations. However, current transformation languages provide only scarce support for debugging. This is mainly due to the fact that low-level information of an according execution engine is provided only, e.g., variable values. Finally, the operational semantics is hidden by these execution engines, which further aggravates finding failures and hampers understanding of transformation specifications.\nTo tackle the aforementioned limitations, this thesis provides three main contributions. First, a declarative, visual language called PAMOMO is proposed, which allows to formally specify requirements on model transformations by means of contracts. To test if a model transformation fulfills the specified requirements, the contracts are compiled into check-only QVT Relations, providing dedicated error traces in case a contract fails. These traces may then be used as hints for debugging. To support debugging, Transformation Nets as a DSL on top of CPNs are proposed, which provide a dedicated runtime model for model transformations, making the hidden operational semantics explicit as a second major contribution. Finally, based on this runtime model various means of debugging are presented as a third contribution.\nTo evaluate the contributions, relations to competing approaches are drawn in a first step. Second, case studies are used to show the applicability of the presented approaches. To evaluate the runtime model, the operational semantics of dedicated transformation languages is made explicit in terms of Transformation Nets. Finally, the debugging support is evaluated again by case studies and a first user study.\nAbstract and paper may be found in our publication database.\n","date":1589891907,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891907,"objectID":"0768fca4ff9d2840e0da2652d8c294ba","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/phd-thesis/archive/testing-and-debugging-of-model-transformations/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:27Z","relpermalink":"/phd-thesis/archive/testing-and-debugging-of-model-transformations/","section":"phd-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in December 2011.\nModel-Driven Engineering (MDE) proposes an active use of models to conduct the different phases of software development.

The design of databases by view integration means that several users or groups of users define their views on the proposed database. These views are collected and integrated to one conceptual database schema.\nWe treat view integration in the context of modeling business processes and workflows and use the object-oriented data model Object/Behavior Diagrams to define the structure and behavior of business objects. In this work, we will focus on the definition and integration of views of the behavior of objects. Behavior of business objects is defined based on a two-schema architecture: Business processes define the overall behavior of business objects according to external business rules, which mainly reflect long-term business rules due to natural facts or law; workflows represent the current processing of business objects in an organization according to internal business rules.\nUsers define their views as they perceive processing of business objects in everyday business, thereby modeling workflows. Further, views of different users comprise different information: (1) Views model behavior of different entities of the real world; (2) views define processes at different levels of detail or omit parts of the processes; (3) views contain comparable information that is defined using different modeling concepts; (4) views define specifications of activities by providing an interface or refer to activities without defining an interface.\nThe goal of view integration is to define the complete set of object types and business processes in the conceptual database schema. Thus, information relevant for the business processes is extracted from the workflows, the object types of the integrated schema are determined, and a business process as well as the activity specifications are defined for each object type. The goal of view integration is to define object types with business processes in a way that the processing of objects according to a business process in the conceptual schema can be observed as a correct processing in each view if information that is not defined in the view is ignored.\n ","date":1589891904,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891904,"objectID":"55d1000e419cc0ba1ca5250d3e98df42","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/phd-thesis/archive/definition-of-behavior-in-object-oriented-databases-by-view-integration/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:24Z","relpermalink":"/phd-thesis/archive/definition-of-behavior-in-object-oriented-databases-by-view-integration/","section":"phd-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in September 1998.\nDatabases in large organizations are usually designed by a group of people including potential future users of the database who know the application domain from everyday business.","tags":["Finished"],"title":"Definition of Behavior in Object-Oriented Databases by View Integration","type":"phd-thesis"},{"authors":["Werner Obermair"],"categories":[],"content":"This work has been finished in February 1998.\nThe design of active object-oriented databases includes modeling the structure of objects, their passive behavior in the form of operations that can be performed on them, and their active behavior in the form of business rules. Business rules are statements about business policies and can be formulated according to the event-condition-action structure of rules provided by active database systems, which allow to react to predefined situations by performing an operation if a certain condition is satisfied when the event occurs.\nAn approach that has been followed successfully in conventional database design is to perform database design in two phases: In the first phase, the conceptual design, a high-level graphical representation of the database schema is developed. In the second phase, the logical design, the developed schema is mapped to the data model of the system used for the implementation. We adopt this approach for the design of active object-oriented databases.\nWe introduce Active Object/Behavior Diagrams for the conceptual design of active object-oriented databases. Active Object/Behavior Diagrams seamlessly extend Object/Behavior Diagrams, an existing high-level graphical language for modeling the structure and the passive behavior of objects, with concepts for modeling business rules. Modeling business rules at the conceptual level requires different concepts than currently provided by active object-oriented database systems and by recent approaches to active object-oriented database design. Active Object/Behavior Diagrams introduce a graphical rule and event language the meets the identified requirements.\nDuring logical design, a schema developed with Active Object/Behavior Diagrams is mapped to a logical schema of an existing active object-oriented database system. We present such a mapping for TriGS, a prototype of an active object-oriented database system built on top of the commercial object-oriented database system GemStone (GemStone Systems, Inc.). The mapping decomposes the high-level constructs of Active Object/Behavior Diagrams into lower-level constructs of TriGS. The presented mapping covers all three dimensions of a schema specified with Active Object/Behavior Diagrams: object structure, passive object behavior, and active object behavior.\n ","date":1589891903,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891903,"objectID":"b018a13375438242c9f48b40c39c8931","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/phd-thesis/archive/active-object-oriented-databases-from-conceptual-design-to-logical-design/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:23Z","relpermalink":"/phd-thesis/archive/active-object-oriented-databases-from-conceptual-design-to-logical-design/","section":"phd-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in February 1998.\nThe design of active object-oriented databases includes modeling the structure of objects, their passive behavior in the form of operations that can be performed on them, and their active behavior in the form of business rules.","tags":["Finished"],"title":"Active Object-Oriented Databases: From Conceptual Design to Logical Design","type":"phd-thesis"},{"authors":["Christian Pichler"],"categories":[],"content":"This work has been finished in December 2011.\nThe United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT) envisions seamless information exchange between business partners in electronic commerce.

This need arises, on one hand, from the fact that there are many different business process modeling formalisms, for example the ADONIS R Standard Modeling Method , UML 2.1 Activity Diagram, the Event-driven Process Chain Method, and, the Business Process Modeling Notation. These formalisms provide different ways to express and represent the same aspects of business process modeling. On the other hand, existing model transformation approaches, like ATL, QVT, and Fujaba, use very general concepts for transforming models for different purposes. However, recurring structures have been observed when transforming models in the area of business process modeling. This leads to the assumption, that there are similar transformation problems in a distinct area. These recurring structures, however, are only inadequately supported by existing transformation approaches.\nThis thesis analyzes the different ways of how business process modeling aspects are represented in various business process modeling formalisms. Furthermore, existing transformation approaches are evaluated concerning their suitability for transforming models in the area of business process modeling. Based on this evaluation, special requirements and solutions for model transformations in the area of business process modeling are derived. These solutions lead to the construction of the Model Morphing approach, which consists of an integrated metamodel and morphing methods which operate based on this metamodel. The Model Morphing approach makes it possible to concentrate on the specific transformation problems within a distinct domain. Furthermore, it reuses existing model transformation approaches and reduces the need for excellent programming skills when defining model transformations.\n Download the paper\n","date":1589891902,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891902,"objectID":"92f578dfa86e985f1c761360e245371f","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/phd-thesis/archive/the-model-morphing-approach-horizontal-transformation-of-business-process-models/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:22Z","relpermalink":"/phd-thesis/archive/the-model-morphing-approach-horizontal-transformation-of-business-process-models/","section":"phd-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in February 2008.\nOwing to company mergers and business to business interoperability, there is a need for model transformation in the area of business process modeling to facilitate model integration and model synchronisation.","tags":["Finished"],"title":"The Model Morphing Approach - Horizontal Transformation of Business Process Models","type":"phd-thesis"},{"authors":["Elke Michlmayr"],"categories":[],"content":"This work has been finished in May 2007.\nPeer-to-peer networks and folksonomies are like living organisms, ever growing and changing as time goes on. This thesis addresses the applicability of algorithms derived from the self-organizing and emergent behavior observed from ant colonies to these complex networks for two specific purposes, namely (1) content-based search in unstructured peer-to- peer networks, and (2) the extraction of adaptive user profiles from folksonomies.\nFor search in unstructured peer-to-peer networks, the main goal is to find the shortest path from every querying peer to one or more answering peers that possess resources which are appropriate answers for the given query. The S EM A NT algorithm, which is designed for this task, is based on reputation learning. In reputation learning, the information about the remote peers’ resources is gained passively by observing the user queries and their answers that are forwarded through the local peer. Every successful query evokes small updates in the routing tables of those peers that are included in the path between the querying and the answering peer. The routing tables are used for subsequent queries to decide which link to follow in order to find appropriate resources. The S EM A NT algorithm is compliant with the Ant Colony Optimization meta-heuristic, and it employs a probabilistic procedure to select outgoing links for query forwarding. This procedure combines an exploiting strategy, which selects those links currently known as the most appropriate ones, with an exploring strategy, which also follows links not currently known as the best ones with the aim of finding better paths not yet explored. A weight defines the ratio between the strategies.\nSince the S EM A NT algorithm is a content-based approach to peer-to-peer search, its performance depends on how the content is distributed in the network. The evaluation of the algorithm includes an investigation to which extent this is the case. Based on these results, we develop strategies for improvement. Under the assumption that the resources in the network are annotated according to a taxonomy, and that the query vocabulary is restricted to the leaf topics from the same taxonomy, it is possible to consider also the upper-level topics in the query routing procedure of the algorithm in order to increase its performance.\nAnt algorithms include an evaporation feature for integrating a time factor when incrementally creating solutions. This feature is beneficial for the task of learning adaptive user profiles from tagging data. For this purpose we design the Add-A-Tag algorithm, which is based on a combination of an evaporation feature for adapting the user profile to trends over time, and the co-occurrence technique for determining the relationships between tags. The user profiles created with the Add-A-Tag algorithm are semantic networks derived from the structure of the tagging data, and they are adaptive in the sense that they change according to changes in a user’s tagging behavior. In addition to the long-term interests of a user, also his or her short-term interests are included in the profile at any given point of time. We present a tool for visualizing the changes in the profile over time, and we show how to exploit the profile for personalized browsing of annotated data sources.\n Download the paper\n","date":1589891901,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891901,"objectID":"d561bfd2cc2ea2422301eeff671bfab1","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/phd-thesis/archive/ant-algorithms-for-self-organization-in-social-networks/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:21Z","relpermalink":"/phd-thesis/archive/ant-algorithms-for-self-organization-in-social-networks/","section":"phd-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in May 2007.\nPeer-to-peer networks and folksonomies are like living organisms, ever growing and changing as time goes on.

Both the evolution of stock prices and interest rates is frequently described in this manner. Starting from a known state, and covering a future time horizon of multiple periods, these models take the form of scenario trees. As a special case, the structure collapses into a lattice, if the tree is “recombining”. This work deals with the two problem classes of determining prices of financial instruments, and of determining optimal portfolios of assets, with respect to some objective function and constraints. Dynamic optimization techniques allow for multiple planning periods, whereas stochastic dynamic optimization problems take into account also probabilities and exhibit (exponentially growing) tree structures, which can become very large. As an example, a model of ten years of three assets, each of which is described by the extents and probabilities of rising or falling of their respective prices within a year, results in a scenario tree with more than one billion (23 )10 = 1 073 741 824 terminal nodes. Computation times for solving these problems can extend to hours and days, hence high performance computing techniques of achieving speed up are desirable.\nThe major approach for performance improvement in this work is parallel computing. It includes the parallel implementation of Monte Carlo simulation techniques as well as of backward induction methods for pricing path dependent interest rate derivatives, in particular constant maturity floaters with embedded options. In the optimization part, the nested Benders decomposition method of multistage stochastic optimization has been parallelized in a synchronous as well as in an asynchronous version. The parallel implementations obtain speedups ranging from reasonable to excellent and demonstrate the potential of high performance computing for financial applications. In addition, they served as case studies in the development of software tools for high performance computing within the framework of the Special Research Program No. F011 Aurora “Advanced Models, Applications and Software Systems for High Performance Computing” of the Austrian Science Fund (FWF).\nThe data parallel programming language HPF+, with extensions for clusters of SMPs, has been successfully employed in the implementation of pricing algorithms. A path notation has been specified as an extension to Fortran 95, allowing for the high level formulation of parallel algorithms operating on lattice structures. The parallel programming model of a distributed active tree has been designed and implemented on top of Java’s threads and RMI. Parallel implementations of the nested Benders decomposition algorithm in Java demonstrate that this is a suitable language for high performance computing. The OpusJava component framework, as well as the JavaSymphony class library, and the distributed active tree model proved their usefulness as programming support environments in the implementation of parallel tree structured algorithms.\nIn addition to the parallelization of sequential existing algorithms, the improvement of known parallelization approaches, and the use of specialized parallel programming languages and programming models, an increase in performance has been achieved by algorithmic developments. The generalization of the classical backward induction method allows for the faster calculation, i.e., in linear instead of exponential time, of prices of a class of instruments exhibiting “limited” path dependence, demonstrating that highly effective approaches of performance improvement combine the levels of algorithms and parallel implementation.\n Download the paper\n","date":1589891901,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891901,"objectID":"1c52c812e3b13b0bdb32d604e966b528","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/phd-thesis/archive/high-performance-computing-in-finance-on-the-parallel-implementation-of-pricing-and-optimization-models/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:21Z","relpermalink":"/phd-thesis/archive/high-performance-computing-in-finance-on-the-parallel-implementation-of-pricing-and-optimization-models/","section":"phd-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in May 2006.\nHigh Performance Computing is useful in the field of finance for solving problems which are defined on models of financial variables in the form of sequences of scenarios along with their realization probabilities.","tags":["Finished"],"title":"High Performance Computing in Finance - On the Parallel Implementation of Pricing and Optimization Models","type":"phd-thesis"},{"authors":["Stefan Mijatov"],"categories":[],"content":"In model-driven development, modeling languages provide the means for software development on a higher level of abstraction than traditional general purpose languages.

To enable an AIS to precisely record economic data and apply reasoning on them, it is crucial that the data structure of an AIS is built upon the economic phenomenas of a company’s business. Accordingly, it is already important to have a detailed understanding of the company’s economic actions at the design time of an AIS.\nLike in most software development projects, the dilemma during design time of an IT product is the language barrier between the domain expert, providing vital input for defining the requirements, and the IT professional, designing and developing the IT product. In most cases the domain expert is not capable of understanding IT specific terms, and the IT professional is not capable of completely understanding the specific area of the domain expert. Nevertheless, to successfully complete an IT product, these two groups still need to unambiguously communicate with each other by using a common language.\nWhen designing an AIS, the domain at hand is the accounting/business domain. Thus, a business modeling language describing economic phenomenas of a company can be used as such a common language to define requirements. One powerful business modeling language today is the Resource-Event-Agent ontology (REA). It not only allows describing events of the present and the past, it also allows specification of commitments made for future events. Consequently, it perfectly fits our requirement to capture the economic phenomenas of an AIS. However, REA is somewhat vague in the definition of its concepts and the current representation is merely IT related, which makes it hard to be understood by business experts. Accordingly, REA still cannot be used as a common communication language for the AIS design phase.\nGiven these limitations, in this thesis we have taken upon the challenge to develop an unambiguous and intuitive graphical domain-specific representation for the REA ontology called the REA-DSL. First, we formalize the REA ontology by providing a REA-DSL meta-model incorporating the REA concepts resources, events, agents, commitments, and types as well as concepts known from database modeling. Subsequently, we create a graphical notation for the REA-DSL using different shapes for different REA concepts. Additionally, to reduce the complexity of the models, we split the REA-DSL into five interlinked views. A serialization format for the REA-DSL is provided by the REA-XML language. Furthermore, we specify a mapping between the conceptual REA-DSL and a database description language. This enables the semi-automatic generation of database structures for an AIS.\nThe presented REA-DSL serves as an unambiguous and powerful business modeling language which can be used by IT and business experts for faster designing a robust AIS.\nAbstract and paper may be found in our publication database.\n","date":1589891900,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891900,"objectID":"36f79b10fac502a7f071f1ab6f2ab339","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/phd-thesis/archive/rea-dsl-business-model-driven-data-engineering/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:20Z","relpermalink":"/phd-thesis/archive/rea-dsl-business-model-driven-data-engineering/","section":"phd-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in June 2012.\nAccounting Information Systems (AIS) are essential for companies not only to record and track what events are happening or what events have happened in the past, they are also one of the most important tools for management to predict the financial future of a firm and take according actions.","tags":["Finished"],"title":"REA-DSL: Business Model Driven Data Engineering","type":"phd-thesis"},{"authors":["Dieter Merkl"],"categories":[],"content":"This work has been finished in November 1994.\n","date":1589891900,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891900,"objectID":"72b1cec064925f9e8e524755b524721d","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/phd-thesis/archive/self-organization-of-software-libraries-an-artificial-neural-network-approach/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:20Z","relpermalink":"/phd-thesis/archive/self-organization-of-software-libraries-an-artificial-neural-network-approach/","section":"phd-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in November 1994.","tags":["Finished"],"title":"Self-Organization of Software Libraries: An Artificial Neural Network Approach","type":"phd-thesis"},{"authors":["Philip Langer"],"categories":[],"content":"This work has been finished in December 2011.\nModel-driven engineering (MDE) is evermore adopted in academia and industry for being a new paradigm helping software developers to cope with the ever increasing complexity of software systems being developed. In MDE, software models constitute the central artifacts in the software engineering process, going beyond their traditional use as blueprints, and act as the single source of information for automatically generating executable software.\nAlthough MDE is a promising approach to master the complexity of software systems, so far it lacks proper concepts to deal with the ever growing size of software systems in practice. Developing a large software system entails the need for a large number of collaborating developers. Unfortunately, collaborative development of models is currently not sufficiently supported. Traditional versioning systems for code fail for models, because they treat models just as plain text files and, as a consequence, neglect the graph-based nature of models.\nA few dedicated model versioning approaches have been proposed, which directly operate on the models and not on the models‘ textual representation. However, these approaches suffer from four major deficiencies. First, they either support only one modeling language or, if they are generic, they do not consider important specifics of a modeling language. Second, they do not allow the specification of composite operations such as refactorings and thus, third, they neglect the importance of respecting the original intention behind composite operations for detecting conflicts and constructing a merged model. Fourth, the types of detectable conflicts among concurrently applied operations is insufficient and not extensible by users.\nTo tackle these deficiencies, we present four major contributions in this thesis. First, we introduce an adaptable model versioning framework, which aims at combining the advantages of two worlds; the proposed framework is generic and offers out-of-the-box support for all modeling languages conforming to a common meta-metamodel, but also allows to be adapted for enhancing the versioning support for specific modeling languages. Second, we propose a novel technique, called model transformation by demonstration, for easily specifying composite operations. Besides being executable, these composite operation specifications also constitute the adaptation artifacts for enhancing the proposed versioning system. More precisely, with our third contribution, we present a novel approach for detecting applications of specified composite operations without imposing any dependencies on the employed modeling environment. Fourth, we present a novel approach for detecting additional types of conflicts caused by concurrently applied composite operations. Furthermore, we contribute additional techniques for revealing potentially obfuscated or unfavorable merge results. Besides introducing the contributions from a conceptual point of view, we provide an open source implementation of these concepts and present empirical case studies and experiments for evaluating their usefulness and ease of use.\nDownload the slides\nAbstract and paper may be found in our publication database.\nDownload the paper\n","date":1589891899,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891899,"objectID":"174cc3d021199c3fedf799a21947a6af","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/phd-thesis/archive/adaptable-model-versioning-based-on-model-transformation-by-demonstration/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:19Z","relpermalink":"/phd-thesis/archive/adaptable-model-versioning-based-on-model-transformation-by-demonstration/","section":"phd-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in December 2011.\nModel-driven engineering (MDE) is evermore adopted in academia and industry for being a new paradigm helping software developers to cope with the ever increasing complexity of software systems being developed.","tags":["Finished"],"title":"Adaptable Model Versioning based on Model Transformation By Demonstration","type":"phd-thesis"},{"authors":["Philipp Liegl"],"categories":[],"content":"This work has been finished in December 2009.\nAutomated business-to-business (B2B) interactions between companies are constantly superseding old paper-based processes. This automation of inter-organizational processes requires a two-fold agreement between the participating business partners. First of all, business partners must agree on a common process choreography, unambiguously defining the exact exchange order of business documents in an inter-organizational business process. Consequently, business partners must agree on the structure of the exchanged business information as well. The two main business document paradigms, which are we elaborate on in this thesis, are top-down business document standards and bottom-up business document standards. The research question, this thesis aims to solve, is how to provide appropriate methods for the definition of business documents for inter-organizational business processes. Due to their special characteristics, such as the involvement of various stakeholders from different companies, the definition of business documents for inter-organizational business processes is not as straightforward as the definition of business documents for intra-organizational business processes. For the definition of inter-organizational business documents we employ two different approaches – a top-down approach and a bottom-up approach. For both approaches we provide appropriate methods for the definition of business documents, the mapping between different business document definitions, and the derivation of XML-based deployment artifacts from business document definitions. We thoroughly cover state-of-the art in the domain of inter-organizational business documents and inter-organizational business processes. This thesis starts by giving an introduction to the domain of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and shows the transition of data-centric EDI solutions to modern B2B systems in Chapter 1. Thereby, the specific requirements for B2B interactions are elaborated – in particular in regard to the definition of the exchanged business information. We motivate the findings of this thesis using an accompanying example from the domain of pan-European waste transport, which is introduced in Chapter 2. In Chapter 3 we provide a survey of current state-of-the-art in business documents standards. Chapter 4 provides an introduction to UN/CEFACT’s Core Components, a top-down business document standard which is key to this thesis. In a nutshell, core components are implementation neutral building blocks for assembling business documents. Although this implementation neutrality is one of the strengths of core components, it hinders a broad diffusion of the standard, since no common representation format for core components is available. To address this issue, this thesis provides three reference representation formats for core components: (i) a UML Profile for Core Components (Chapter 5), (ii) a Domain Specific Language for Core Components (Chapter 6), (iii) and a Web Ontology Language representation for Core Components (Chapter 7). The derivation of XML Schema artifacts from core components, which may be deployed to IT systems, is covered in Chapter 8. A successful diffusion of core Components may only be achieved if a broad user community has access to the necessary core component definitions. Consequently, we provide a registry meta-model for core components in Chapter 9. Bottom-up business document standards are subject to discussion in the second part of this thesis. Thereby, domain specific extensions to bottom-up document standards are introduced in Chapter 10. Consequently, we examine how to map bottom-up standard definitions to core component based top-down standard definitions in Chapter 11. Finally, we show how to combine business choreography models and business document models in Chapter 12. Related work is discussed in Chapter 13 and Chapter 14 concludes the contributions of this thesis. In summary this thesis provides the following seven contributions: (1) An overview of business document standards, based on standard clusters; (2) three reference representation formats for core components using the Unified Modeling Language, Domain Specific Languages, and Web Ontology Language for Core Components; (3) an unambiguous derivation of XML Schema artifacts from UML based core component models; (4) a registry meta-model for a core component registry; (5) domain specific extensions for an XML based bottom-up business document standard; (6) a mapping of bottom-up business document standards to top-down business documents standards; (7) an integration of UML based core component models in UML based business choreography models. In short the overall approach facilitates the definition of business documents in an inter-organizational context and fosters reuse of existing business document definitions.\nAbstract and paper may be found in our publication database.\n","date":1589891899,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891899,"objectID":"81dce990b954947b3c1d0f9a29aea942","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/phd-thesis/archive/business-documents-for-inter-organisational-business-processes/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:19Z","relpermalink":"/phd-thesis/archive/business-documents-for-inter-organisational-business-processes/","section":"phd-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in December 2009.\nAutomated business-to-business (B2B) interactions between companies are constantly superseding old paper-based processes.

In this paradigm, a system is defined by means of models using modeling languages that enable developers to abstract away from implementation and platform details. From the models, complete implementations may be (semi-)automatically generated by utilizing model transformation techniques. As MDE puts models into the center of software development, adequate methods for creating, analyzing, and utilizing models are crucial. Due to the large body of used modeling languages, means for efficiently developing adequate tool support for modeling languages are needed. To address this need, the automation techniques provided by MDE may also be applied to automate the development of such tool support. This is current practice for developing syntax-based tools. However, the automated development of semantics-based tools has not reached the same level of maturity yet. The goal of this thesis is to fill this gap and provide a solution for automating the development of semantics-based tools for executable modeling languages. Therefore, a language and methodology for developing behavioral semantics specifications based on the standardized language fUML are proposed. To provide the basis for developing semantics-based tools, the execution environment of fUML was extended with means for execution control, runtime observation, and runtime analysis. Based on these extensions, a generic model execution environment for modeling languages whose behavioral semantics is defined with fUML was developed. This environment provides the foundation for developing semantics-based tools for executable modeling languages, which has been shown by the implementation of a semantic model differencing tool and other semantics-based tools.\nAbstract and paper may be found in our publication database.\nDownload the paper\n","date":1589891899,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891899,"objectID":"c5b3e2e7bb73144ad80a8e6da30c2eba","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/phd-thesis/archive/defining-executable-modeling-languages-with-fuml/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:19Z","relpermalink":"/phd-thesis/archive/defining-executable-modeling-languages-with-fuml/","section":"phd-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in December 2014.\nModel-driven engineering (MDE) is a software development paradigm aiming to cope with the growing complexity of software systems by raising the level of abstraction.","tags":["Finished"],"title":"Defining Executable Modeling Languages with fUML","type":"phd-thesis"},{"authors":["Peter Lang"],"categories":[],"content":"This work has been finished in September 1997.\nBusiness rules are statements about business policies and can be formulated according to the event-condition-action structure of rules provided by active database systems, which allow to react to predefined situations by performing an operation if a certain condition is satisfied when the event occurs.\nThe conceptual design of active object-oriented databases includes modeling the structure of objects, their passive behavior (the operations that can be peformed on objects), and their active behavior (rules that allow objects to react autonomously to predefined situations by performing an operation). Modeling business rules at the conceptual level by means of the active behavior of objects requires different concepts than currently provided by active object-oriented database systems and by recent approaches to active object-oriented database design.\nThis thesis presents a high-level graphical language called Active Object/Behavior Diagrams, which meets the requirements identified for modeling business rules at the conceptual level. Active Object/Behavior Diagrams extend the already introduced Object/Behavior Diagrams with Situation/Activation Diagrams, a graphical rule and event language.\nIn order to cope with the complex domain of business applications, concepts for specializing the object structure and the passive behavior have been elaborated and presented in the diverse literature. Specializing active behavior (business rules) has received little attention so far. This thesis extends the specialization concepts already defined for Object/Behavior Diagrams with the concepts for specializing Situation/Activation Diagrams.\nThe usage of modeling concepts is constrained by a set of consistency rules. They have the designer stick to a correct usage of the modeling concepts in order to achieve a consistent database schema. Even if all consistency rules are obeyed, different designers may yield different consistent database schemata, which may differ in their quality.

One of the advantages of these systems is that they can be better adapted to physical, organizational and software-technological requirements.\nDevelopers of distributed systems are confronted in the construction process with problems which do not appear or only appear in a restricted form in the development of non-distributed systems. Examples of such problems are: mapping distributed resources and/or processes onto a set of computers; paralleling process steps; identification and handling of faults, etc. Monitoring and dynamic program analysis should support software development of distributed systems. The support should occur in such a way that system requirements can be met, the above mentioned problems can be solved, and distributed systems can be observed.\nThe work is divided into seven chapters. Besides the chapters introduction and conclusion, there are five chapters with the following topics: terms of distributed systems; distributed systems requirements and problems during the development of such systems; monitoring concepts; existing monitoring systems; and the monitoring system Orwell.\nThe second chapter describes important terms of distributed systems. Starting with the term »system« , a characterization of distributed system will be made, to discuss important properties of these systems. Based on the properties and terms, we discuss important concepts and mechanisms, which play an important role in the construction of distributed systems.\nThe third chapter describes on the basis of the above mentioned concepts and mechanisms, important aspects of distributed systems from the view of software engineering. Such aspects are reliability, fault tolerance, efficiency, scalability and security. After that, we discuss problems of the development process of distributed systems. Additionally, object-oriented systems will be discussed. Furthermore, we will discuss aspects like time and causality, which are important for monitoring distributed systems.\nThe fourth chapter consists of a discussion of basic monitoring-system requirements. The main part of the chapter is about the general monitoring model of Mansouri-Samani[95] and its concepts, activities, and strategies for the observation and analysis of distributed systems.\nThe fifth chapter consists of a presentation of selected monitoring research approaches and tools.\nThe sixth chapter describes the monitoring system Orwell. The architecture of the distributed and object-oriented analysis environment and its functionality will be discussed.

They develop business process models defining which activities have to be executed in which order under which conditions by whom and by using which resources. For this purpose a lot of different approaches to business process modelling have been developed, which resulted in many different Business Process Modelling Languages (BPMLs).\nThe definition of a business process has to cover many different aspects (e.g. control flow, organizational view, data view, etc.). A perfect business process modelling approach would address all the different aspects. Unfortunately, none of the existing approaches provides concepts for addressing all of these aspects. Each of them concentrates on some aspects. The focus on certain aspects is mainly due to the different applications areas, e.g. business engineering or software engineering etc.\nAlthough BPMLs are well established in industry and science, a comprehensive evaluation or a framework for an evaluation to compare the different BPMLs is still missing. Thus, it is the goal of this thesis to provide an evaluation framework for the comparison of BPMLs and to apply this framework in the evaluation of the currently most popular BPMLs. The resulting framework is based on a generic metamodel that captures all of the concepts appearing in any of the state-of-the-art BPMLs. On a high level this framework addresses the following views: Business Process Context Perspective, Behavioural Perspective, Functional Perspective, Informational Perspective, and Organisational Perspective. An evaluation based on this framework checks whether the certain aspects in each of these perspectives is supported by the concepts of each of the considered BPMLs. In the evaluation of this thesis, we used the following languages: UML 2 Activity Diagram, Business Process Modelling Notation, Event Driven Process Chain, IDEF3, Petri Net, Role Activity Diagram.\nAccording to the evaluation we were able to identify three main problems in current BPMLs. The first problem is that the definition of the dependency between business processes and their supporting software systems is inadequately supported. In our approach we support the elicitation of requirements from business process models for the software systems to be developed by extending current BPMLs with software requirements and components to ensure a business-goal oriented software development.\nThe second problem concerns the variability of similar, but well-distinguished software products within a software product line. These software products not only differ in its structural definition, but also in the process to create them. Today, variability modelling is a domain specific modelling technique that is limited to the structural definition of similar software products. In our approach we extend the concepts of variability modeling to integrate the dynamical aspects into the UML. The resulting approach is based on a well defined dependency between UML class diagrams and UML activity diagrams.\nThe third problem is that current conceptual BPMLs do not provide explicit modelling means for process goals and their measures. The modelling of goals and its monitoring is a critical step in business process modeling. Hence, we extend the metamodels of UML 2 AD, EPC and BPMN with business process goals and performance measures. These concepts become explicitly visible in the corresponding models. Furthermore, a mapping of the performance measures onto the Business Process Execution Language (BPEL) enables their monitoring in an execution environment.\n Download the paper\n","date":1589891897,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891897,"objectID":"538df2b9d325e6ef27d0a72961ddcb1f","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/phd-thesis/archive/business-process-modelling-languages-goals-and-variabilities/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:17Z","relpermalink":"/phd-thesis/archive/business-process-modelling-languages-goals-and-variabilities/","section":"phd-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in January 2008.\nOver the last decade more and more companies started to optimize their business processes in a way to meet its business goals.

Interorganizational workflows support such cooperations in a way similar to traditional intraorganizational workflows that support business processes within an organization. The distinct characteristics of inter-organizational workflows, such as heterogeneity and autonomy of the participating software systems, has lead to the development of several new XML-based technologies supporting inter-organizational cooperation. These technologies, however, introduce additional complexity into the development of inter-organizational workflows. Model driven development is an approach to master these complexities by using higher-level models as main development artifacts. In the model driven architecture (MDA), UML can be employed as common modelling language for models at various levels of abstraction and various technologies.\nThe goal of this thesis is to exploit the application of MDA for model driven development of inter-organizational workflows. In this respect, several contributions are made.

Second, an extension of UML for platform-specific modelling of XML documents is defined, specifically addressing the problem of round-trip engineering.

Due to historical, organizational, and technical reasons, their infrastructure is usually characterized by the keywords distribution and heterogeneity, in the sense that an organization comprises several physically distributed and heterogeneous information system components. In fact, particulary within an organization, such system components are frequently interrelated. To enable their cooperation and to ensure one common access, it is required to achieve interoperability and to further integrate them logically. However, distribution and heterogeneity represent the most relevant barriers against the development of interoperable, logically integrated information systems.\nThis thesis presents three systems realizing middleware to overcome these barriers, called COMan, IRO-DB, and OASIS. COMan integrates an object-oriented application and a relational database, providing persistence for complex objects and object-oriented manipulation of relational data. IRO-DB focuses on the integration of arbitrary relational as well as object-oriented database systems and constitutes a database federation. OASIS deals with the integration of arbitrary security concepts at an abstract description level, enabling their central monitoring and administration despite heterogeneity.\nAll these systems achieve logical integration. They provide transparency with respect to distribution and heterogeneity while preserving the autonomy of the system components being integrated as far a possible. To allow for a flexible and generic integration all systems realize a metadata-based approach. This metadata-based approach prevents the hard-coding and distribution of the transformation knowledge, required due to distribution and heterogeneity aspects, over various system components. Rather, it is centralized in a reified way within a repository, thus, resulting in a system able to perform the essential transformations automatically and open to adapt to changing requirements.\nBased on the experience gained by developing these three systems, a criteria catalogue is developed allowing to categorize and evaluate different kinds of metadata-based middleware. The applicability of this catalogue is demonstrated by comparing the three introduced approaches by means of the proposed criteria.\n ","date":1589891896,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891896,"objectID":"5881a6fec69bc5fe50409e8e037cebfe","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/phd-thesis/archive/metadata-based-middleware-for-integrating-information-systems/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:16Z","relpermalink":"/phd-thesis/archive/metadata-based-middleware-for-integrating-information-systems/","section":"phd-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in April 1999.\nToday, information systems are widely employed for administrating large amounts of data of various application areas.

It has started with theintegration of database schemas in the early eighties. With the rise of the Semantic Web andthe emerging abundance of ontologies, the need for an automatic information integration increased further.\nInformation integration in general and automatic information integration in particular is a huge and challenging research area. One of the main problems is handling semantic heterogeneity and schema heterogeneity. Manually finding the semantically overlapping parts of schemas is a tedious problem. Furthermore, writing integration code is a labor intensive, error-prone, and cumbersome task. A lot of approaches have already been developed to automate this work. Nevertheless, not all integration problems have been solved so far.\nMatching tools are used to automatically find similarities between schemas. The results of these tools are simple correspondences. Based on these correspondences, one is able to write integration code. However, the simple correspondences are just suggestions and must be verified manually. Hence, the completeness and correctness of the resulting correspondences may not be assured. Furthermore, it is not possible to automatically derive transformation code for all found simple correspondences.\nIn order to write transformation code, different kinds of transformation languages have been developed. The produced code is too customized for a specific type of schema to be easily reused for other integration problems. Hence, to the best of our knowledge, there exists no transformation language to develop reusable transformation patterns for different kinds of heterogeneity problems.\nThis thesis addresses the heterogeneity problems, as well as the lack of reusable transformation code, and the need for establishing correct and complete correspondences between schemas. The first two problems are tackled by developing an executable declarative mapping language, which is able to cope with the core of schema heterogeneity problems. In contrast to simple correspondences, this mapping language is able to express more constraints. Based on these more expressive mappings, the execution code is automatically derived. The third problem is tackled by a self-tuning, iterative matching approach. This approach is based on the developed mapping language. Mapping strategies are responsible for the application of mapping operators. Based on the executable mapping suggestion, completeness and correctness are achieved for a provided set of instance models by a test-driven approach. These instance models are used to evaluate the produced mapping model. The prototype of this self-tuning approach is called SmartMatcher.\n[1] Laura Haas.

The web services vision promises that programs are made more flexible and powerful by querying Internet databases (registries) at runtime in order to discover information and network attached third-party building blocks. Services can advertise themselves and related metadata via such databases, enabling the assembly of distributed higher-level components. In support of this vision, this thesis shows how to support expressive general-purpose queries over a view that integrates autonomous dynamic database nodes from a wide range of distributed system topologies.\nWe motivate and justify the assertion that realistic ubiquitous service and resource discovery requires a rich general-purpose query language such as XQuery or SQL. Next, we introduce the Web Service Discovery Architecture (WSDA), which subsumes an array of dis- parate concepts, interfaces and protocols under a single semi-transparent umbrella. WSDA specifies a small set of orthogonal multi-purpose communication primitives (building blocks) for discovery. These primitives cover service identification, service description retrieval, data publication as well as minimal and powerful query support. The individual primitives can be combined and plugged together by specific clients and services to yield a wide range of be- haviors and emerging synergies. Based on WSDA, we introduce the hyper registry, which is a centralized database node for discovery of dynamic distributed content, supporting XQueries over a tuple set from an XML data model. We address the problem of maintaining dynamic and timely information populated from a large variety of unreliable, frequently changing, autonomous and heterogeneous remote data sources.\nHowever, in a large cross-organizational system, the set of information tuples is partitioned over many such distributed nodes, for reasons including autonomy, scalability, availability, performance and security. This suggests the use of Peer-to-Peer (P2P) query technology. Consequently, we take the first steps towards unifying the fields of database management systems and P2P computing. As a result, we propose the WSDA based Unified Peer-to-Peer Database Framework (UPDF) and its associated Peer Database Protocol (PDP), which are unified in the sense that they allow to express specific applications for a wide range of data types (typed or untyped XML, any MIME type), node topologies (e.g. ring, tree, graph), query languages (e.g. XQuery, SQL), query response modes (e.g. Routed, Direct and Referral Response), neighbor selection policies, pipelining, timeout and other scope characteristics.\nThe uniformity and wide applicability of our approach is distinguished from related work, which (1) addresses some but not all problems, and (2) does not propose a unified framework.\n Download the paper\n","date":1589891895,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891895,"objectID":"972f2030f21e1bf9f3200f9cb33d1fda","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/phd-thesis/archive/a-univied-peer-to-peer-database-framework-for-xqueries-over-dynamic-distributed-content-and-its-application-for-scalable-service-discovery/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:15Z","relpermalink":"/phd-thesis/archive/a-univied-peer-to-peer-database-framework-for-xqueries-over-dynamic-distributed-content-and-its-application-for-scalable-service-discovery/","section":"phd-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in March 2002.\nIn a large distributed system spanning administrative domains such as a Grid, it is desirable to maintain and query dynamic and timely information about active participants such as services, resources and user communities.","tags":["Finished"],"title":"A Univied Peer-to-Peer Database Framework for XQueries over Dynamic Distributed Content and its Application for Scalable Service Discovery","type":"phd-thesis"},{"authors":["Sabine Graf"],"categories":[],"content":"his work has been finished in December 2007.\nLearning management systems (LMSs) such as WebCT, Blackboard, and Moodle are commonly and successfully used in e-education. While they focus on supporting teachers in creating and holding online courses, they typically do not consider the individual differences of learners. However, learners have different needs and characteristics such as prior knowledge, motivation, cognitive traits, and learning styles. Recently, increasing attention is paid to characteristics such as learning styles, their impact on learning, and how these individual characteristics can be supported by learning systems. These investigations are motivated by educational theories, which argue that providing courses which fit the individual characteristics of students makes learning easier for them and thus, increases their learning progress.\nThis thesis focuses on extending LMSs to provide adaptivity by incorporating learning styles according to the Felder-Silverman learning style model. An automated approach for identifying learning styles from the behaviour and actions of learners has been designed, implemented, and evaluated, demonstrating that the proposed approach is suitable for identifying learning styles. Based on this approach, a standalone tool for automatic detection of learning styles in LMSs has been implemented.\nFurthermore, investigations have been conducted on improving the automatic detection of learning styles by using additional information from cognitive traits. The potential of working memory capacity is investigated. Results of a comprehensive literature review and two comprehensive evaluation studies show that relationships between working memory capacity and learning styles exist and that these relationships can provide additional information for the detection process of learning styles.\nMoreover, a concept for extending LMSs by enabling them to automatically generate and present courses that fit the students’ learning styles has been developed, implemented, and evaluated, using Moodle as a prototype. Results show that the proposed concept for providing adaptive courses is successful in supporting students in learning.\nBy extending LMSs with adaptivity, a learning environment is built that supports teachers as well as learners. In such an adaptive LMS, teachers can continue using the advantages of LMSs and learners can additionally benefit from adaptive courses. This research opens ways for advanced learning systems, which are able to learn the needs and characteristics of learners, respond to them immediately, and provide learners with courses where adaptation is frequently improved and updated to the learners’ needs.\n Download the paper\n","date":1589891895,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891895,"objectID":"0b54a5b5acb492a0faaa510ae7113b49","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/phd-thesis/archive/adaptivity-in-learning-management-systems-focussing-on-learning-styles/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:15Z","relpermalink":"/phd-thesis/archive/adaptivity-in-learning-management-systems-focussing-on-learning-styles/","section":"phd-thesis","summary":"his work has been finished in December 2007.\nLearning management systems (LMSs) such as WebCT, Blackboard, and Moodle are commonly and successfully used in e-education.

Without proper verification techniques this error can propagate through all subsequent refinements and into the executable code. Clearly, this circumstance is undesirable.

In MDE, problem domains are specified using domain-specific modeling languages and models are concrete problem instances that abstract from reality to reduce complexity. At the heart of MDE, model transformations are used to systematically manipulate these problem models to find good solutions to the problem at hand. However, reasoning about how the transformation needs to be orchestrated to find good solutions is a non-trivial task due to the large or even infinite transformation space. As a result, this task is either performed automatically, e.g., by following an apply-as-long-as-possible approach, which does not necessarily produce satisfactory results, or it is carried out manually by the respective engineer. This, in turn, hampers the application of MDE techniques on complex problems which usually cannot be solved manually or by enumerating all possible solutions.\nTherefore, we present in this thesis an approach that facilitates to solve these problems by stating clear objectives operationalized through model-based analysis techniques and elevating search-based optimization methods to the model level to find optimal transformation orchestrations. As first contribution, we introduce a model-based analysis approach that measures dynamic, timed properties that consider the contention of resources directly on the model level using the fUML standard. As second contribution, we provide a generic encoding of the transformation orchestration problem on which many different optimization methods can be applied. Using this encoding, we propose an approach that enables to solve problems by providing a model, a set of transformation rules, a set of objectives that are optimized during the process and a set of constraints that mark invalid solutions. The optimization process is configured through a dedicated language which provides information on the optimization concepts and immediate feedback for the concrete configuration. The results consist of the respective orchestrated transformations, the solution models, the objective and constraint values as well as analysis details about the optimization process. Our approach is based on graph transformations and has been implemented as an open-source framework called MOMoT. Based on this implementation, we provide an extensive evaluation of our approach using several case studies from the area of model-driven software engineering as well as two novel problem formulations that tackle the modularization of model transformations and the generic modularization of modeling languages.

We present a comprehensive, conceptual workflow model that is to be used in early phases of the design of workflow systems that have high demands on security. The workflow model follows a uniform object-oriented approach.\nThe processes of organizations need often be adapted to changed requirements in the business environments of organizations. We propose a novel schema architecture for the modeling of organizational processes. The so-called „two-schema architecture“ separates, according to its origin, knowledge on organizational processes into external knowledge, e.g., natural facts and law, and internal knowledge, i.e., organizational commitments. Since organizations have no influence on external knowledge – at least no direct influence -, most adaptions of organizational processes cause only changes to internal knowledge. The „two-schema architecture“ supports to a high degree the reuse of knowledge on organizational processes and eases the adaption of organizational processes to changed requirements in the business environments of organizations.\nThe structure of organizations is typically organized around business functions of organizations. The structure of modern organizations is organized around the processes of organizations. As a result, the vertical hierarchy of organizations is flattened. Typically, actors work in network-like groups, which may be easily adapted to changed requirements. We support the modeling of both forms of organization structures, i.e., hierarchies and networks.\nThe security requirements of organizational processes say to which actors authorizations can be issued, in which form particular authorizations must be represented (e.g., key cards), and how authorizations that have been issued to actors must be maintained. Basic security requirements for workflow systems are: (1) Accesses of actors that do not possess appropriate authorizations must be denied. (2) Authorizations that are in conflict with the security requirements of organizational processes must not be issued. We specify the security requirements of a workflow system in an authorization schema. A workflow management system can use such an authorization schema as a filter to exclude authorizations that are illegal wrt. the protection requirements of organizational processes from its authorization base.\n ","date":1589891893,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891893,"objectID":"63e8d8c3ed76a93ee084aafdcc65328d","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/phd-thesis/archive/conceptual-design-of-secure-workflow-systems-an-object-oriented-approach-to-the-uniform-modeling-of-workflows-organizations-and-security/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:13Z","relpermalink":"/phd-thesis/archive/conceptual-design-of-secure-workflow-systems-an-object-oriented-approach-to-the-uniform-modeling-of-workflows-organizations-and-security/","section":"phd-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in May 1998.\nThe conceptual design of workflow systems comprises the modeling of organizational processes, organization structures, and security requirements.

The model building process requires multiple people jointly elaborating on artifacts, which are analyzed, used to communicate among stakeholders, and act finally as construction plan for realizing the modeled system. In the field of software engineering, modeling languages such as the Unified Modeling Language (UML) provide multiple diagrams to describe various viewpoints of a system in a concrete graphical notation. While the code-centric software engineering discipline adopted those models as visual language for describing the system under study, the increasing complexity of modern software systems accompanied by ever shorter time to market constraints has asked for new techniques. The upcoming Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) approach aims at additionally exploiting models to automatically generate executable code. This paradigm shift lifts models to first-class citizens within the whole engineering process, effectively shaping the primary artifact of change undergoing the collaborative refinement from informal sketches to blueprints. This upgrowth intrinsically demands tool support for managing the models‘ history including merging of parallel evolved models. Optimistic versioning systems, which are already successfully applied for the management of source code, handle both issues. However, applying those systems to models fails due to the models‘ graph-based structure. Consequently, first dedicated model versioning systems emerged. Although current model versioning systems provide decent conflict detection facilities, they (1) ignore the graphical representation of the models, and (2) neglect conflict resolution by totally shifting the responsibility to the user. Yet, the central role of models unifying the human-centric, collaborative abstraction and design process with the computation-centric process of generating executable systems, demands proper mechanisms to foster validity and quality of the merged model.\nIn this thesis, we first analyze specifics of model versioning and elaborate on the notion of conflict to improve conflict resolution respecting the central role of models. To cope with the human-centric aspect, we present a conflict aware merge strategy to calculate a tentatively merged conflict diagram as accelerator for conflict resolution retaining the graphical representation of the model. The conflict diagram unifies non-conflicting changes and materializes merge conflicts in form of annotations, rendering a coherent picture of the model’s evolution. To further support the conflict resolution process, we elaborate on a conflict resolution recommender system on top of the conflict diagram, which recommends automatically executable conflict resolution patterns. Finally, to satisfy validity conditions of the computation-centric aspect, we establish a formal framework based on graph transformation theory, to showcase the feasibility of our approach.\nAbstract and paper may be found in our publication database.\n","date":1589891893,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891893,"objectID":"6bb7021ac75e96328d37c9d23410b21a","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/phd-thesis/archive/conflict-resolution-in-model-versioning/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:13Z","relpermalink":"/phd-thesis/archive/conflict-resolution-in-model-versioning/","section":"phd-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in July 2012.\nIn most engineering disciplines, models are built as pragmatic, yet precise abstractions of huge systems.

Its language-inherent extension mechanism is being applied to systematically integrate domain-specific concepts via libraries and profiles because they are indispensable for model-based engineering (MBE). Cloud computing is an appealing target domain for MBE. Modern cloud environments support a relatively high degree of automation in service provisioning, which allows cloud users to dynamically acquire services required for deploying cloud applications. On the other hand, MBE aims at increasing the automation of application development by a systematic tool-supported refinement of high-level models towards a target platform and the environment underneath. The selected platform and environment designate the technical target domain whose concepts have to be captured on the model level in order to enable the refinement of architectural models. Modeling concepts and tools along with a set of constraints on how they can be used denote an architecture style. Providing an architecture style for cloud application modeling based on UML including tools that exploit automated processes of both cloud computing and MBE is thus highly desirable. Due to the generic nature of UML, it does however not provide cloud modeling concepts by default and existing UML tools do not yet adequately support cloud-specific model refinement.\nTo address these deficiencies, the goal of this thesis is to realize cloud-specific extensions to UML and a toolset that together form an architecture style for developing cloud applications. In particular, we place emphasis on the automation of development processes and their effectiveness in producing truly useful models. Four main contributions are presented to achieve this goal. First we systematically review current cloud modeling languages (CMLs) and investigate major cloud environments to derive a core set of features inherent to the cloud computing domain. They serve as the basis for developing the UML- based cloud application modeling language (CAML), which is the second contribution. CAML supports semi-automatic model refinement towards the Java platform and three major cloud environments via dedicated libraries and profiles. The third contribution addresses the automatic translation of UML architecture models refined by CAML into TOSCA, a recently adopted standard that aims at automating application provisioning and management. Combining UML and TOSCA closes the gap between architecture modeling and application provisioning. As model transformations are key to automate the refinement and translation of model-based artifacts, maintaining those transformations and their produced artifacts is addressed by the fourth contribution.

Most of the documents are Web pages whose data is considered to be in XML format, expecting it to eventually replace HTML, the current lingua franca of the Web, e.g., by XHTML.\nA common problem in designing and maintaining a Web site is that data on a Web page often replicates or derives from other data, the so-called base data, that is usually not contained in the deriving or replicating page. Two properties of Web sites account for this situation. First, the hypertext structure of a Web site not necessarily coincides with the structure of its underlying conceptual domain model, thus it may be necessary to present a single data item on several pages. Second, the content of pre-generated Web pages is often drawn from legacy systems, usually relational databases. In this case Web pages replicate data items from databases.\nConsequently, replicas and derivations become inconsistent upon modifying base data in a Web page or a relational database. For example, after modifying a product’s price in the database, already pre-generated Web pages offer the product at an out-dated price. Or, after assigning a thesis to a student and modifying the Web page that describes it in detail, the thesis is still incorrectly contained in the list of offered thesis, missing in the list of ongoing thesis, and missing in the advisor’s teaching record.\nThe thesis presents a solution by proposing a combined approach that provides for maintaining consistency of data in Web pages that (i) replicate data in relational databases, or (ii) replicate or derive from data in Web pages. Upon modifying base data, the modification is immediately pushed to affected Web pages. There, maintenance is performed incrementally by only modifying the affected part of the page instead of re-generating the whole page from scratch.\nThe proposed approach provides for consistent, up-to-date Web pages any time. It is efficient by providing incremental page maintenance techniques, generic by maintaining consistency of XML data in general, flexible by reacting to modifications in Web pages of other businesses, transparent by maintaining a business’ autonomy in managing its data, open by allowing future extensions to be built on top of it, and extensible by enabling the integration of arbitrary legacy systems.\n Download the paper\n","date":1589891892,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891892,"objectID":"7c43cc7da944ea03f37f60895855db65","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/phd-thesis/archive/maintaining-consistency-of-data-on-the-web/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:12Z","relpermalink":"/phd-thesis/archive/maintaining-consistency-of-data-on-the-web/","section":"phd-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in December 2004.\nIncreasingly more data is becoming available on the Web, estimates speaking of 1 billion documents in 2002.

Until now, however, this language did not attract the same interest as the Unified Modeling Language (UML), because of the lack of adequate debugging facilities which are necessary regarding the following three problem areas: First, declarative languages like QVT Relations (QVT-R) hides the operational semantics of transformations. Only the information provided by the interpreter, as well as the tendered inputs and returned outputs are available for tracking the progress of transformations. Furthermore, the ordering of transformation application is hidden by the MT engines providing only a black-boxes view to the users. This can lead to the problem of impedance mismatches between design and runtime. These characteristics of QVT-R are assets for developing, but are handicaps for debugging. Second, QVT-R code is specified on higher abstraction level than its execution and state-of-the-art debugging. This deteriorates the ability to deduce causes from produced results. Third, the information content responsible for operating MTs is spread over several artifacts including the input model, a resulting target model and the QVT-R code. As a consequence, the reasons for a particular outcome are hard to be derived from the involved artifacts. This severely harms the ease of debugging. Therefore, this master thesis tackles the mentioned problems by visualizing QVT-R as Transformations Nets, using the MT framework „Transformations On Petri Nets In Color“ (TROPIC) based on Colored Petri Nets (CPN). This can be seen as explicit definition of operational semantics on a high abstraction level providing a white-box view for debugging QVT-R. This thesis proposes a procedure model formulated in a conceptual approach and in a prototypic implementation striving for bridging the existing gap between these two different paradigms by mapping the concepts of QVT Relations to such nets. In this thesis three particular contributions are provided: (i) a solution approach for unidirectional mappings producing target models from an existing source model, (ii) the support for model inheritance, (iii) and synchronization approaches for timely and version-based incremental changes.\n Download the paper and poster\n","date":1589891887,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891887,"objectID":"99e6c9e580992a9b49baa01d851e6f81","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/archive/graphical-debugging-of-qvt-relations-using-transformation-nets/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:07Z","relpermalink":"/master-thesis/archive/graphical-debugging-of-qvt-relations-using-transformation-nets/","section":"master-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in December 2009.\nModel transformations (MT) play a key role in the Model Driven Engineering (MDE) paradigm, leading to the standardization of the Query/View/Transformation (QVT) model transformation language by the Object Management Group (OMG).","tags":["Finished"],"title":"Graphical Debugging of QVT Relations using Transformation Nets","type":"master-thesis"},{"authors":["Patrick Zwickl"],"categories":[],"content":"This work has been finished in February 2011.\nAbstract and paper may be found in our publication database.\nDownload the poster\n","date":1589891887,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891887,"objectID":"2f4be35092702e1e9f728e4bb8c58401","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/archive/visual-design-and-analysis-support-for-answer-set-programming/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:07Z","relpermalink":"/master-thesis/archive/visual-design-and-analysis-support-for-answer-set-programming/","section":"master-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in February 2011.\nAbstract and paper may be found in our publication database.\nDownload the poster","tags":["Finished"],"title":"Visual Design and Analysis Support for Answer Set Programming","type":"master-thesis"},{"authors":["Carina Zöchmeister"],"categories":[],"content":"This work has been finished in July 2005.\nDiese Arbeit beschäftigt sich mit e-Learning und e-Learning Plattformen.

An example for such a code review tool is Gerrit which is used in popular open source projects such as the Android Open Source Project, Eclipse, LibreOffice and many others. Code reviews aim at finding and preventing mistakes introduced by changed artifacts before they are merged into the actual software project. The actual form of such a review varies and ranges from pair programming to formal inspections. However, the basic review process supported by most of the review tools is as follows: The review process is started by a contributor who provides one or more new or modified artifacts to the project. One or more reviewers provide feedback, leave comments on the contribution and decide whether the contribution will be accepted to be merged into the project or not. If not, the contributor may provide new versions of these artifacts based on the feedback of the reviewers and the process starts over again.\nThis process requires to keep track of the changes introduced to the artifacts and previous feedback, which together form a review history. To support this, most of the source code review tools provide visualization of differences among the changed artifacts and additional annotations, such as comments tied to a specific scope of the text data. However, to the best of our knowledge, these visualizations only support textual artifacts, such as source code. Apart from binary artifacts, this way of visualization is also a problem for artifacts that encode data with text, but are hard to read for humans, such as models and diagrams.\nIn Model-Driven Engineering, models are the most important artifacts of a software project. Such models are represented by a textual syntax or a graphical syntax. The previously mentioned visualizations are dedicated to show differences between textual artifacts and are hence suitable for models with a textual syntax. However, they do not support models using a graphical syntax, unless they can be encoded in text. Although the latter is technically possible, it is desirable to visualize the changes and annotations using the graphical representation, as this overcomes the burden of learning another representation and keeping them in sync.\nThe aim of this thesis is to develop a set of visualization techniques to visualize graphical models in the context of review processes. Prototype implementations of the resulting techniques and case studies will be used to verify the results. These prototypes will be built on top of popular open source frameworks and tools used in Model-Driven Engineering, such as Eclipse, and the Eclipse Modeling Framework.\n ","date":1589891886,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891886,"objectID":"38156849efa2b064523a8ffcb43a387f","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/archive/visualization-of-evolving-graphical-models-and-diagrams-in-the-context-of-model-review/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:06Z","relpermalink":"/master-thesis/archive/visualization-of-evolving-graphical-models-and-diagrams-in-the-context-of-model-review/","section":"master-thesis","summary":"Source code review tools are part of many large scale software development processes.

Jedoch wird MDA zurzeit nur als eine Vision gesehen, da die notwendige Basis für die Realisierung fehlt. Betroffen davon ist auch der Web Engineering Bereich, da bestehende Web-Modellierungsmethoden im Sinne der MDA nicht vollständig modellgetrieben sind. Es fehlen die entsprechenden Metamodelle zu den Web-Modellierungssprachen und die Modelltransformationen, um Modellaustausch zwischen den Web-Modellierungswerkzeugen zu gewährleisten.\nDiese Arbeit versucht eine erste Lösung für das Interoperabilitätsproblem zwischen den verschiedenen Web-Modellierungswerkzeugen umzusetzen. Ob eine verlustfreie Abbildung zwischen eingesetzten Web-Modellierungssprachen entwickelt werden kann, bildet die zentrale Forschungsfrage, die im Zuge dieser Arbeit beantwortet wird. Um diese Forschungsfrage zu beantworten, wird folgende Methode eingesetzt. Im ersten Teil der Arbeit werden die wesentlichen Eigenschaften von Web- Modellierungssprachen erklärt und anhand der entsprechenden Tools untersucht. Im zweiten Teil der Arbeit werden die Metamodelle für die einzelnen Modellierungssprachen erstellt und anhand eines Fallbeispiels detailliert untersucht. Im dritten Teil der Arbeit werden anhand des modellierten Fallbeispiels Unterschiede und Gemeinsamkeiten der Modellierungssprachen bestimmt. Der vierte Teil der Arbeit beschäftigt sich mit der Erstellung der Modelltransformationen für die Realisierung des Modellaustausches. Zusätzlich werden die zu realisierenden Modelltransformationen nach vordefinierten Kriterien wie Informationsverlust und Realisierbarkeit bewertet.\n Download the paper and poster\n","date":1589891884,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891884,"objectID":"4d72e67e45c14f09d60f21ff9a55f680","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/archive/metamodell-basierte-integration-von-web-modellierungssprachen/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:04Z","relpermalink":"/master-thesis/archive/metamodell-basierte-integration-von-web-modellierungssprachen/","section":"master-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in October 2008.\nWeb-Anwendungen haben sich über die letzten Jahrzehnte stark verändert.

Schenkt man den vielen Versprechungen der OMG Glauben, so lassen sich aus technologieunabhängigen Modellen problemlos Anwendungen für verschiedenste Plattformen wie J2EE, CORBA oder .NET automatisch generieren. Dabei gibt die OMG nur eine theoretische Architektur und Spezifikation von MDA vor, die Implementierungen von Werkzeugen bzw. Transformationsregeln wird an die Softwareindustrie abgegeben. Diese soll in nächster Zeit für Automatisierungstools sorgen, die die Modelltransformationen und weitere Hilfsmittel für den erfolgreichen Einsatz von MDA unterstützen.\nIn der Praxis wurden schon mehrere Projekte mittels MDA auf Basis der bereits vorhandenen Werkzeuge verwirklicht. Die Vision dabei ist, dass Softwareanwendungen automatisch generiert werden. Hier ist aber zu klären, ob die Tools wirklich Anspruch auf MDA haben oder ob es sich „nur“ um UML Tools handelt, die Codeseg- mente automatisch aus grafischen Modellen ableiten können.\nDie Diplomarbeit beschreibt ausführlich die theoretischen Konzepte von MDA sowie die praktische Umsetzung von MDA anhand eines Ausschnitts des CALENDARIUM-Projektes. Die theoretischen Konzepte wie plattformunabhängiges Modell, plattformabhängiges Modell, Modelltransformationen und Metamodellierung werden ausführlich erklärt und diskutiert. Dabei werden einerseits Probleme der Transformation der verschiedenen Modelle (vom Business Modell bis hin zum Code) aufgezeigt, sowie die Auswirkungen auf den Softwareentwicklungsprozess untersucht. Weiters wird auf die manuelle Erstellung von Transformationsregeln eingegangen. Anhand eines Kriterienkatalogs werden die Anforderungen an MDA-Werkzeuge diskutiert und existierende Werkzeuge untersucht.

In den 1990er Jahren setzte sich schließlich die objektorientierte Softwareentwicklung durch. Nun scheint diese Evolution ihre Fortsetzung durch modellgetriebene Ansätze zu finden. Diese Ansätze versuchen die objektorientierte Program mierung durch grafische Modelle zu ergänzen, und so auch die Software allgemeiner zu gestalten, um gegebenenfalls auch die eigentliche Programmiersprache ersetzen zu können.

Das Ziel dieses umfangreichen Projekts war die Konzeption, Modellierung und Implementierung einer Web-Anwendung mit Customizationunterstützung, dh. einer Web-Anwendungen, die aufgrund verschiedener Kontextfaktoren wie Benutzer, Zeit, Ort, Gerät, etc., mit der Adaptierung ihrer Dienste reagiert.\nHierbei ist eine entsprechende Kontextbehandlung insbesondere betreffend die Repräsentation, die Erfassung und die Auswertung von Kontextinformation von entscheidender Bedeutung. Darüber hinaus ergibt sich einerseits das Problem, dass sich die Kontexterfassung und die Auswertung des aktuellen Kontexts über die gesamte Web-Anwendung erstreckt. Andererseits sind diese Funktionalitäten meist auch fix im Sourcecode verankert, wodurch die Wartung und Flexibilität des Systems erheblich eingeschränkt wird. Daher sollen diese Komponenten möglichst gekapselt und separiert von der restlichen Anwendung implementiert werden, was in dieser Arbeit mit Hilfe von aspektorientierter Programmierung gelöst wird.\nFür ubiquitäre Web-Anwendungen und die Customization ihrer Dienste ist der Kontext das Basiselement, ohne welchem keine Adaptierung möglich ist.

Sie stellt gewissermaßen das Fundament dieser Abläufe dar. Software ist zu einem kritischen Bestandteil vieler Unternehmen und Lebensbereiche geworden. Analog zu dieser Bedeutunksteigerung stehen die Entwicklungsmethoden mehr und mehr im Spannungsfeld von hoher Qualität des Endprodukts und niedrigen Entwicklungskosten bzw. kurzen -zyklen. In der Realität können viele Projekte diesen Ansprüchen nicht gerecht werden. Um den Softwareschaffenden neue Werkzeuge zu bieten, die es ermöglichen diese gegensätzlichen Ziele zu vereinbaren, gibt es seit geraumer Zeit, die Bestrebung Code automatisch aus einem Modell der zu entwickelnden Applikation zu generieren.\nEiner dieser Ansätze ist die Modellgetriebene Software Entwicklung (eng: Model Driven Software Development, kurz MDSD). Bei MDSD wird basierend auf einem in den meisten Fällen graphischen Modell durch Transformationen lauffähiger Sourcecode erzeugt. Stahl und Völter beschreiben in ihrem Buch „Modellgetriebene Software Entwicklung“ [1] einen pragmatischen Ansatz um mit Hilfe von MDSD und bereits heute verfügbaren Techniken den Infrastrukturcode einer Applikation bzw. einer ganzen Software-Systemfamilie zu generieren. Diesen Ansatz bezeichnen sie als architekturzentrierte-MDSD (AC-MDSD). Es wird dabei versucht den Infrastrukturcode einer definierten Softwaresystemfamilie möglichst vollständig zu generieren. Eine Softwaresystemfamilie ist die Summe aller Applikationen die auf derselben Architektur und technologischen Plattform beruhen.\nDie Codegenerierung bei AC-MDSD stützt sich auf zwei Säulen. Zum einen werden die verwendeten Modelle mittels einer so genannten Domain Specific Language (DSL) formalisiert. Die DSL spiegelt mit ihren Ausdrucksmitteln den Problemraum der jeweiligen Domäne wieder. Die Konzepte der DSL werden durch ein Metamodell der Domäne abgebildet. Zum anderen erleichtert der Einsatz eines Frameworks und wieder verwendbarer Komponenten die Erzeugung des Sourcecodes, da der „Weg“ zwischen Generat und Modell verkürzt wird.\nIm Rahmen dieser Diplomarbeit wird ausgehend von den in [1] beschriebenen theoretischen Konzepten und dem von den Autoren des Buches mitentwickelten Codegenerator Toolkit openArchitectureWare (oAW) [2], die konkrete Vorgehensweise bei der Softwareerstellung mittels AC-MDSD an Hand eines praktischen Beispiels aus dem Bereich „Softwareinfrastruktur für E-Business-Anwendungen“ veranschaulicht. Die Umsetzung erfolgt mit Hilfe von Technologien aus dem J2EE Bereich wie JSPs, Servlets, Enterprise JavaBeans und dem Webframework Struts. Fachlich handelt es sich dabei um eine Online-Buchhandlung. Im Rahmen der Durchführung soll auch die Erstellung eines GEF-Editors für die DSL mit Hilfe von oAW veranschaulicht werden. Neben diesen praktischen Aspekten der Arbeit werden die für das Verständnis nötigen theoretischen Konzepte dargelegt, und eine Abgrenzung zu verwandten Methoden wie MDA durchgeführt. Abschließend wird eine kritische Evaluierung hinsichtlich der Praxistauglichkeit des vorgestellten Ansatzes vorgenommen. Dabei werden sowohl dessen Stärken als auch Schwächen gegenübergestellt.\nQuellenverzeichnis\n[1] Markus Völter, Thomas Stahl; Modellgetriebene Softwareentwicklung. dpunkt.verlag, 1.

The developers of software are only required to concentrate on developing models in PIM format. The transformation to PSM and Code, which is the traditional understanding for UML model transformation can be automatically achieved by using general transformation tools.\nThe traditional way of developing UML transformations is usually to develop a specific one to one transformation using a fixed set of rules and profiles. The development of the transformation is usually complicated and time consuming. Due to the many different forms of UML, the transformation between these UMLs has been proved to be a very tough and inefficient.\nSince the introduction of MDA, MOF(Meta Object Facility) and QVT (Query, View and Transformation) concepts from the Object Management Group(OMG), UML transformations come to a new era. Many working groups have presented their concepts and made their implementation using these definitions.\nThis diploma thesis gives an introduction to the principle of UML transformation according to MDA, MOF and QVT. It also gives an evaluation of the up to date model transformation tools based on these concepts to show their strength and weaknesses. These state of the art transformation tools are built according to OMG MOF 2.0 Query / View / Transformation. The evaluated tools are UMT, MTL, ATL, GMT, BOTL and OptimalJ.\nIn this diploma thesis the analysis methods described in a review of OMG MOF 2.0 QVT [Gardner03]are used.

Models represent information of the system, while transformations allow converting one or more input models to specific output models. In the last years, more and more transformation languages were introduced to allow MDSE to be applied to a wide spectrum of use cases. Today, many advanced scenarios can be expressed by MDSE and the use of new transformation languages. However, in every non-trivial project, multiple transformations have to be executed in particular order to yield the final result. Most transformation languages do not allow to be integrated in such an orchestration. They either lack interfaces to the outside and hence violate the black box principal or need a specific execution context, such as a running development environment. In this thesis, I analyze several existing tools for Transformation Orchestration, which try to overcome these problems to allow for the orchestration of various transformation languages to one transformation chain. I then take inspiration from these tools and other domains, such as Build Management and Workflow Management, to create a new tool for Transformation Orchestration called Moola. Especially concepts from build tools such as Gradle can be applied to Transformation Orchestration. If we see the models of the last transformation as overall outcome, the whole orchestration can be seen as build process. Like Gradle, Moola will be implemented as domain-specific language in Groovy. This allows for powerful, yet easy to read orchestration mark-up. Moola will then be evaluated against use cases taken from the ARTIST project.\n","date":1589891882,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891882,"objectID":"158dbaf1cfadd151c244f14755d17dc9","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/archive/moola-a-groovy-based-model-operation-orchestration-language/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:02Z","relpermalink":"/master-thesis/archive/moola-a-groovy-based-model-operation-orchestration-language/","section":"master-thesis","summary":"A core concept of Model-Driven Software Engineering (MDSE) is the use of models and transformations.

Syntaxfehler und Inkonsistenzen im Modell wirken sich daher direkt auf den Quellcode aus. Bearbeitet nur ein Entwickler ein Modell, so kann ein zumindest in sich konsistentes Modell durch die von der Entwicklungsumgebung zur Verfügung gestellten Werkzeuge gewährleistet werden. Arbeiten jedoch mehrere Entwickler kollaborativ an einem Modell, was der realistischere Fall ist, muss dieses unter Versionskontrolle (version control system, VCS) gestellt werden. Herkömmliche textbasierte Ansätze zur Versionierung sind für graphische Modelle jedoch nicht ausreichend.\nDie Verwendung von konventionellen VCS zur Versionierung von Modellen bringt zwei grundlegende Probleme mit sich. Das erste Problem bezieht sich auf die auftretenden Konflikte zwischen zwei Modellversionen, z.B. wenn mehrere Entwickler gleichzeitig dasselbe Modellelement ändern. Diese Konflikte müssen durch die Entwickler manuell aufgelöst werden, da für eine Zusammenführung der Änderungen keine Werkzeugunterstützung existiert. Treten bei der manuellen Zusammenführung der Änderungen Fehler auf, hat dies dierekten Einfluss auf den generierten Quellcode. Das zweite Problem bezieht sich auf Information, die während der Konfliktauflösung entsteht, aber für zukünftige ähnliche Konfliktsituationen nicht gespeichert wird und daher nicht wiederverwendet werden kann. Diese Information könnte jedoch dem Entwickler bei späteren Konfliktauflösungen hilfreich sein. Außerdem könnten auf Basis dieser Information über mögliche Konfliktsituationen Entwurfsrichtlinien für die Erstellung eines Modells vorgegeben werden.\nDer in dieser Arbeit vorgestellte Ansatz zur Konfliktauflösung ermöglicht eine Beschreibung von Auflösungsstrategien für syntaktische und statisch semantische Konflikte. Zur Beschreibung der syntaktischen Konflikte und deren Auflösung wird eine modellbasierte, deskriptive Sprache vorgestellt. Zur Auflösung der statisch semantischen Konflikte werden Graph-Produktionsregeln bzw. Muster mittels OCL genutzt.\nDurch den modellbasierten Ansatz der Sprachdefinition für die Beschreibung der Auflösungsstrategien ist eine einfache und flexible Erweiterung bzw. Änderung der Strategien möglich. Die gemeinsame Struktur bildet die Grundlage für eine Protokollierung der Benutzerentscheidungen. Aus diesen können zusätzliche Informationen zur Unterstützung des Benutzers bei der Entscheidungsfindung der passenden Auflösungsstrategie gewonnen werden. Die Prüfung auf Einhaltung von Entwurfsrichtlinien ist ebenfalls möglich.

Die Integration heterogener Daten in eine neue Anwendung durch den Endanwender, stellt gerade im Einsatz von Unternehmen ein großes noch ungenutztes Potential dar.\nSo arbeiten viele Unternehmen mit hoch integrierten ERP Systemen, die einen Großteil der Daten zur Steuerung der Prozesse enthalten. Allerdings sind nicht alle Informationen vollständig im ERP System enthalten bzw. können nicht alle Operationen über das ERP System ausgeführt werden. Es entsteht die Situation bei der Daten aus unterschiedlichen Systemen zusammengeführt und daraus Entscheidungen getroffen werden müssen. Der Einsatz einer Mashup Applikation, welche bei Bedarf entsprechend der Anforderung erstellt wird, bringt einen entscheidenden Mehrwert für die Fachabteilungen.\nIm Rahmen der vorliegenden Arbeit werden die speziellen Anforderungen wie Datenqualität, die erhöhte Sicherheit bei unternehmerisch sensiblen Daten und die Einbindung von integrierten ERP Systemen als auch von Legacy Applikationen in Enterprise Mashups untersucht. Unter Legacy Applikationen werden alle Arten von unternehmerischen Anwendungen verstanden, die unter Umständen technisch nicht mehr auf dem neuesten Stand sind, allerdings aus verschiedenen Gründen weiterhin im Unternehmen eingesetzt werden. Des Weiteren wird ein Prototyp für ein Enterprise Mashup entwickelt, welcher die Verwendung von Informationen aus dem ERP System Microsoft Dynamics AX in Verbindung mit anderen Mashup Daten erlaubt. Für die Realisierung des Prototyps wird innerhalb Dynamics AX eine Möglichkeit zur Anbindung von Mashups entwickelt. Für das Mashup selbst werden vorhandene Frameworks evaluiert und ein Framework für die Umsetzung des Prototyps gewählt, welches die entsprechenden Dienste zum Erstellen des Mashups und Bereitstellen der Daten für die Clients bietet.\nMit dem exemplarisch umgesetzten Mashup wird die schnelle und unkomplizierte Kombination der Daten unterschiedlicher Anwendungen in den Vordergrund gestellt. Der Prototyp stellt einen Leitfaden für Anwender und Unternehmen dar, um die oft komplizierte technische und organisatorische Umsetzung neuer Applikationen zu vereinfachen. Mit Mashups wird Mitarbeiten ein Werkzeug bereit gestellt, um bei Bedarf selbst ohne Programmierkenntnisse und ohne die Unterstützung der IT Abteilung die notwendige Anwendung oder Auswertung erstellen zu können.\nAbstract and paper may be found in our publication database.\nDownload the poster\n","date":1589891881,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891881,"objectID":"13c2842bbfe4b97c4693525f92e25684","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/archive/enterprise-mashups-a-teaching-case/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:01Z","relpermalink":"/master-thesis/archive/enterprise-mashups-a-teaching-case/","section":"master-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in March 2012.\nDer Einsatz von Enterprise Mashups erlaubt Anwendern ohne technische Kenntnisse aus vorhandenen Daten in unterschiedlichen Systemen ad hoc eine neue Anwendung zu erstellen.","tags":["Finished"],"title":"Enterprise Mashups - A Teaching Case","type":"master-thesis"},{"authors":["Mario Topf"],"categories":[],"content":"This work has been finished in September 2010.\nAbstract and paper may be found in our publication database.\nDownload the paper and poster\n","date":1589891880,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891880,"objectID":"b6e3f32486f929a81acdec2fd6b08c52","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/archive/from-bsopt-dsl-to-windows-workflow/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:38:00Z","relpermalink":"/master-thesis/archive/from-bsopt-dsl-to-windows-workflow/","section":"master-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in September 2010.\nAbstract and paper may be found in our publication database.\nDownload the paper and poster","tags":["Finished"],"title":"From BSopt-DSL to Windows Workflow","type":"master-thesis"},{"authors":["Cornelia Tomasek"],"categories":[],"content":"This work has been finished in January 2008.\nUbiquitäre Web-Anwendungen werden nach dem anytime/anywhere/anymedia Paradigma individuell auf den Benutzungskontext, wie zum Beispiel Zeit, Ort oder Endgerät angepasst. Die Durchführung solcher Customizations ist oft komplex, da sich eine Änderung meist nicht nur auf einen bestimmten Teil der Web-Anwendung bezieht, sondern eine Vielzahl von Stellen betrifft, die in den verschiedenen Ebenen der Web-Anwendung, Content, Hypertext und Präsentation liegen. Im Bereich des Model Driven Engineering ziehen die meisten Web-Modellierungssprachen diese Eigenschaft von Customizations nicht gesondert in Betracht. Änderungen werden, so wie herkömmliche Anpassungen des Models, an mehreren Stellen direkt im Kern-Model vorgenommen. Diese Vorgehensweise führt allerdings bezüglich Wartbarkeit und Erweiterbarkeit zu einer erhöhten Komplexität und damit zu einem ineffizienten Entwicklungsprozess. In aspectWebML, einer Erweiterung der Web-Modellierungssprache WebML, werden Customizations dagegen als so genannte Crosscutting Concerns im Sinne der Aspektorientierung betrachtet und mit Hilfe spezieller aspektorientierter Konzepte behandelt. Diese ermöglichen eine klare Trennung bei der Modellierung von Kernfunktionalität und Crosscutting Concerns, wodurch eine Reduzierung der Komplexität der Modelle, eine Verbesserung der Wartbarkeit sowie der Wiederverwendbarkeit einzelner Customizations erreicht wird.

Voraussetzung zum erfolgreichen und sicheren Durchführen von Touren im Gebirge ist eine sehr genaue Tourenplanung. Diese erhöht die Sicherheit und somit den Erlebniswert.\nVon besonderem Interesse bei der Tourenplanung sind genaue Informationen über den Tourenverlauf sowie über mögliche Gefahren­ und Schlüsselstellen. Die meisten Informationen werden in Textform angeboten. Sowohl Fachliteratur als auch Informationen im Internet beschreiben Touren überwiegend in Worten, es fehlt in der Regel gutes Fotomaterial. Doch gerade dieses verbessert die Vorstellung über eine alpine Tour ganz wesentlich. Sowohl die Orientierung vor Ort als auch die Einschätzung von Schlüsselstellen in der Tour werden durch vorher bekanntes Fotomaterial wesentlich erleichtert.\nAus diesem Grund beschäftigt sich die vorliegende Arbeit mit der Entwicklung einer Internetplattform für den Verlag von fotounterstützten Dokumentationen alpiner Touren. Jede Dokumentation soll dabei genügend Fotomaterial enthalten können, um den gesamten Verlauf einer Tour sowie alle Schlüsselstellen auf der Tour sichtbar zu machen. Die Internetplattform unterstützt also Wanderer und Bergsteiger dabei, ausreichend Bildinformation über bevorstehende Touren für eine ausführliche Tourenplanung zu erhalten. Umgekehrt haben Tourengeher auch die Möglichkeit, als Alpinautoren fotounterstützte Dokumentationen alpiner Touren zu publizieren.\nDa das Durchführen und Erstellen derartiger Dokumentationen stets mit viel Zeit und Kosten verbunden ist, sollen die Kosten durch Verkauf der Dokumentationen nach Möglichkeit gedeckt werden. Die Internetplattform stellt dafür ein geeignetes Verkaufssystem zur Verfügung.\nDie Plattform wurde mit Sommerbeginn 2006 eröffnet1) und stellt als Basisinhalt einen Osttirol Wander­ und Hochtourenführer sowie einen kleinen Zentralpyrenäen Wanderführer zur Verfügung. Da es Berge weltweit gibt und Alpinisten unterschiedlichste Sprachen sprechen, wurde die Internetplattform mehrsprachig ausgeführt, zur Zeit in den Sprachen Deutsch, Englisch und Französisch. So haben Autoren die Möglichkeit, Dokumentationen in mehreren Sprachen zu publizieren und Tourengeher können Dokumentationen in mehreren Sprachen beziehen.\nDie vorliegende Arbeit beschäftigt sich mit der Entwicklung dieser Plattform. Zuerst wird eine Anforderungsanalyse erstellt, welche die Anforderungen einer solchen Plattform aufzeigt. Basierend auf diesen Anforderungen wird die Plattform anschließend modelliert. Der Schwerpunkt der vorliegenden Arbeit liegt in der Modellierung. In dieser werden sämtliche Modelle aufgezeigt, die für eine Realisierung einer derartigen Plattform notwendig sind. Aufbauend auf der Modellierung werden die wichtigsten Teile einer möglichen Implementierung genauer besprochen. Auch rechtliche Grundlagen zum Betrieb der Plattform werden abschließend erörtert.\nGezeigt wird, dass für die Umsetzung eines derartigen Verlages neben umfangreichen technischen und sprachlichen Kenntnissen sowie neben Erfahrungen in der Alpinistik auch grundlegende Kenntnisse in den Gebieten der Buchhaltung und im Daten­ und Informatikrecht notwendig sind.\nDie Realisierung der Plattform stellt sich diesbezüglich als ein multidisziplinäres Projekt in dem spannenden Gebiet des Bergsports heraus.\n Download the paper and poster\n","date":1589891879,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891879,"objectID":"45aeaec7fef6b6463c8f06830facb883","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/archive/entwurf-und-realisierung-einer-internetplattform-fr-den-verlag-von-fotountersttzten-dokumentationen-alpiner-touren/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:37:59Z","relpermalink":"/master-thesis/archive/entwurf-und-realisierung-einer-internetplattform-fr-den-verlag-von-fotountersttzten-dokumentationen-alpiner-touren/","section":"master-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in August 2006.\nImmer mehr Wanderer und Bergsteiger werden durch die Faszination der Gebirgswelt sowie deren Erlebnis­ und Erholungswert in das Gebirge gezogen.

Von Anwenderseite erhält man so eine Art Dokument-Historie, obwohl die Dokumente und deren Versionen völlig dezentral verwaltet werden.\nIm Zuge der Diplomarbeit wird dieses Konzept unter Verwendung der Middleware JXTA [Jxta04] als Prototyp [Tdfs04] realisiert. Jeder Rechner wird als Peer mit einem Namen, einer Beschreibung und einer eindeutigen Peer ID ausgestattet und kann von anderen Peers im Netzwerk gesucht und, wenn gefunden, angesprochen werden. Die Kommunikation erfolgt bei einfachen Mitteilungen über Broadcasting und bei Mitteilungen, deren Empfang unbedingt gewährleistet sein muss, über eine Pipe, die eine direkte Verbindung zwischen zwei Peers darstellt.\nDer Prototyp bietet die Möglichkeit Dokumente und Versionen zu erzeugen und diese mittels der Interaktion Checkin entweder lokal oder remote auf anderen Peers zu platzieren. Weiters ist es möglich, Versionen in andere Versionen hineinzuführen (Merge), sie auf andere Peers zu verschieben (Reallocate) oder sie zu löschen (Delete).\nDokumente können andere Dokumente abonnieren, um das Ereignis zu empfangen, das beim Durchführen einer der oben genannten Interaktionen auf dieses Dokument ausgelöst wird. Das Ereignis wird dabei von Version zu Version weitergeleitet, bis alle Versionen des abonnierenden Dokuments erreicht wurden.

Dazu werden Werkzeuge benötigt, welche den Benutzer dabei unterstützen. Ein Bestandteil von MDSD ist Model Weaving, welches für eine Vielzahl von Anwendungen eine Voraussetzung darstellt. Unter anderem liefert Model Weaving die nötigen Informationen, um daraus Modelltransformationen abzuleiten. Es ist möglich, mehrere Modelle durch diese Modelltransformation in ein Modell zusammen zu führen, Modelle in ihrem Informationsumfang zu erweitern und dergleichen. Herkömmliche Ansätze, wie der ATLAS Model Weaver (AMW) der ATLAS Group, sind als Rich-Client-Anwendung implementiert, was nicht immer von Vorteil ist. Zusätzliche Ressourcen auf der Client-Seite und eine Installation beim Benutzer zählen dazu. Da der AMW Bestandteil des Eclipse Modelling Frameworks ist und nicht jede Version miteinander kompatibel ist, kann es hier zu unerwarteten Schwierigkeiten kommen. Auch in der modellgetriebenen Softwareentwicklung haben sich Plattformen entwickelt, welche den Austausch von Modellen erleichtern sollen. Diese als „Model Repositories“ bezeichneten Plattformen sollen Grundgerüste für die Modellentwicklung bereitstellen. Hier wäre es hilfreich, Verbindungen zwischen den einzelnen „Repositories“ zu schaffen. Ziel dieser Arbeit ist es, basierend auf dem MetaModelbrowser von Jürgen Flandorfer, eine Anwendung zu entwickeln, welche das Thema Model Weaving aufgreift und versucht, dieses mit dem Web zu verbinden. Dies hat den Vorteil, dass dem Benutzer der Umgang mit dem Web vertraut ist, somit kein zusätzlicher Lernaufwand entsteht. Probleme bezüglich Performanz auf der Clientseite werden vermieden und ein leichtgewichtiger, ressourcensparender Client wird geschaffen, welcher keine Installation mehr benötigt. Da eine weitgehend eigenständige Weaving Umgebung geschaffen wird, kommt es nicht zu einem Zusammenspiel mehrerer Softwarekomponenten, wie es beim AMW der Fall ist. Modelle können zentral am Server abgelegt werden. Dies ermöglicht ein gemeinsames Arbeiten an Modellen. Mit einer Funktion des MetaModelbrowsers können Modelle anhand einer URL eingebunden werden. Somit ist es möglich, Model Repositories in den Weaving Prozess mit einzubeziehen. Als Alternative zu den Eclipse basierten Model Weaving Ansätzen soll also eine webbasierte Anwendung geschaffen werden, mit deren Hilfe die Probleme der herkömmlichen Ansätze vermieden werden können.\n Download the paper and poster\n","date":1589891876,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891876,"objectID":"a96daff88b5cb55f07fe7de87745575a","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/archive/model-weaver-2-0-eine-ajax-basierte-web-anwendung-fr-model-weaving/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:37:56Z","relpermalink":"/master-thesis/archive/model-weaver-2-0-eine-ajax-basierte-web-anwendung-fr-model-weaving/","section":"master-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in January 2008.\nModellgetriebene Softwareentwicklung (MDSD) soll dabei helfen, Softwaresysteme hinsichtlich ihrer Komplexität zu vereinfachen und ihre Qualität zu steigern.

Als relativ junge Ingenieursdisziplin, verglichen mit Maschinenbau, Elektrontechnik oder dem Bauingenieurswesen, spielt sie erst seit einigen Jahrzehnten eine tragende Rolle in der technischen Entwicklung. Ihre Bedeutung nimmt seither jedoch kontinuierlich zu. Angefangen, in den 1960ern mit Assemblerprogrammierung, etablierten sich in den 70ern die ersten Hochsprachen am Markt, gefolgt von objektorientierter Programmierung in den 90er-Jahren. Heute steht die nächste Revolution bevor, die Einführung der modellgetriebenen Softwareentwicklung, welche durch ihre noch größere Abstrahierung eine effizientere Arbeitsweise und eine schnellere Projektumsetzung, als mit bisher üblichen Mitteln, erlauben soll. Die Arbeitsschritte, die dabei von einer Entwicklungsumgebung unterstützt werden sollen, werden daher immer komplexer. Schon längst reicht ein einfacher Texteditor mit einem Kommandozeilencompiler nicht mehr aus. Für professionelle Entwicklung wird auch eine professionelle Herangehensweise erforderlich, welche erst durch ausgereifte Werkzeuge ermöglicht wird.\nDie vorliegende Arbeit untersucht, welche Softwareentwicklungsmethoden sich als Standards am Markt etabliert haben und welche Rolle der vielerorts propagierte modellgetriebene Ansatz dabei spielt. Weiters werden die heute größten und bekanntesten integrierten Entwicklungsumgebungen (IDEs) für die Hochsprachen C++ und C# auf deren Fähigkeiten in den Bereichen Modellierung, Programmierung, Softwarequalitätssicherung, Bedienbarkeit, Erweiterbarkeit und Support untersucht. Zu diesem Zweck wird ein Kriterienkatalog vorgestellt, welcher die üblichen Features einer IDE aufzählt und als Bewertungsgrundlage dient.\nDie beiden größten kommerziellen Anbieter für Softwareentwicklungswerkzeuge am PC für die genannten Sprachen sind Borland und Microsoft, daher wird sowohl das derzeit aktuelle Borland Developer Studio (2006), als auch das neueste Microsoft Visual Studio (2005) einer Evaluierung unterzogen. Darüber hinaus wurden zwei Vertreter der Open Source Software ausgewählt. Es sind dies das aus dem Java-Umfeld bekannte Eclipse mit einem C++-Plugin und Sharp Develop für C#. Aufgrund der gewählten IDEs können die beiden größten kommerziellen Produkte ebenso miteinander verglichen, wie auch die Fragestellung behandelt werden, ob Open Source Software in diesem Bereich eine ernstzunehmende Alternative darstellt.\nEine weitere Arbeit, welche IDEs mit Java-basierten Ansätzen untersucht, wurde ebenfalls zeitgleich an der TU Wien / Business Informatics Group durchgeführt. Da Softwareentwicklungsprozesse und Kriterienkatalog unabhängig von der gewählten Programmiersprache sind, wurden jene Teile der Arbeit, welche diese Themen behandeln, gemeinsam erarbeitet.

One of the major challenges in e-commerce is how to align different standards that have emerged over those years [1,2]. Enterprises have to invest substantial financial resources to integrate various heterogeneous systems, in order to communicate within organization systems or among trading partners [3,4,5]. Rapid developments in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) brought new cost-effective opportunities for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) to exchange electronic business documents via the Internet using a wide range of integration tools. The current increasing attention into cloud computing as a way of how to minimize costs and introduce pay-per-use models, proves to be of high relevance for the creation of a cloud-ready tool with future potential [6].\nThe objective of this work is to enable SMEs and non-profit organisations to exchange business documents within B2B e-commerce using free of charge, modern information technologies and systems. In order to minimize investments for infrastructure and application licenses, Web-based solutions accessible as cloud services are proposed. This innovative approach opens new possibilities for addressing common issues with mappings and transformations of business documents. Enabling such a solution should motivate SMEs to start using automated B2B electronic communication.\nThe SmooKs Data Integration (DI) framework, an engine for processing XML and non XML data, currently does not support direct transformation. Therefore an innovative Web-based visual tool, capable of specifying relationships between two XML documents is designed and implemented. The crucial IT artifact of this work, will be the user interface which enables drag and drop mapping of documents and consecutive transformation using the SmooKs DI framework. Furthermore, the whole solution will be deployed as cloud service using Google App Engine and will be accessible from any standard Web browser. The result of this work is the outline of related work on B2B business document standards, mapping and transformation tools.\nThis thesis follows the guidelines of the design science research methodology [7]. The main parts consist of related work relevant to B2B electronic exchange of structured business documents, their mapping and subsequent transformation. When transforming XML documents it is important to understand the model, and schema, as well as query languages [8,9]. Furthermore, an analysis of open source data integration frameworks is conducted, followed by a selection of the SmooKs framework. In order to enable direct transformation using SmooKs for XML and other business document standards, an architectural change of the SmooKs DI framework is proposed.\nIn the technical part, a user interface (UI) will be created. This is elaborated from an analysis of existing integration tools. The relationship between XML structure and tree structure are described in more detail in [10]. And is taken into account for the design of a data model used to map source and target document. The design will be tested via direct transformation of the XML to XML using a template engine and SmooKs hosted as a cloud service. An evaluation of the prototype solution will serve as a proof of utility and form an open issue discussion.\nLarge enterprises, using customized enterprise resource planning systems (ERP), employ more advanced types of middleware such as enterprise application integration (EAI) or enterprise service bus (ESB) for various types of integration. SMEs, to integrate into B2B, focus on less complicated solutions as data integration (DI) tools or software packages, enabling them to extract, transform and load data (ETL) [11]. The market is dominated by commercial products from Informatica, IBM, Microsoft, Oracle, and Pervasive [12], but there are multiple open source data integration frameworks available (Talend, CoverETL, SmooKs, Pentaho) [13]. Talend is the leader in providing open source data integration frameworks. It uses SmooKs for Electronic Data Interchange (EDI). However, the main difference is the value proposition. SmooKs is a framework for Java programmers, while Talend provides a visual tool for non-programmers.\nUsing a visual tool to specify mapping of source and destination is not new, in fact it goes back as far as the first heterogeneous systems [14]. To be more specific, federated database systems (FDBS) managing distributed, autonomous and different databases, laid the cornerstone for a reference architecture of mapping and transformation back in 1980’s [15]. Recent classification as well as analysis of mapping tools for data exchange is highlighting that no tool performs well in all mapping situations [16]. Most of the current market leaders are using integrated development environment (IDE) software applications installed locally on the desktop.\nThe implementation of the Web-based editor for mapping models for the data integration framework SmooKs relates to a wide range of technologies. The jQuery framework, a library for JavaScript, is used for the user interface. The transformation works with help of FreeMarker, a template engine, and uses XML related technologies to generate and produce XML, based on a given schema. The entire solution is hosted as a free-of-charge cloud computing service of a Google App engine using Java. In version 1.4 of SmooKs, automatic transformation for UN/EDIFACT was introduced, thus forming solid foundations for support of ANSI X.12, HL7 and other EDI-based data formats. Strong support for various formats (XML, CSV, Fix Width, EDI, Java, JSON, YAML, etc.) and integration with Apache Camel combined with EDI support make SmooKs a strong business document transformation tool used in several other open source products (JBoss ESB, Talend, Mule ESB, WS02).\nA literature survey reveals an increased interest into XML-based architecture in Web services [8,17]. Due to the simplicity of XML compared to SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language), XML has an important role in the exchange of various kinds of data, in mapping and transformation [8,16,18,19]. Some authors proposed XML to XML transformation using query languages [15,16]. The FreeMarker Template Language (FTL) offers a lightweight alternative to common query languages such as XSLT or XQuery. The SmooKs DI framework in conjunction with FreeMarker can be used to perform XML to XML transformation. Furthermore, SmooKs can extract data from EDI messages or read and write data formats other than XML. Further work is required to explore matching meta-models to automate mapping [20] with help of semantic systems and implement adapters to plug-in other business document standards.\nThe master’s programme in Software Engineering \u0026amp; Internet Computing deals with all aspects of distributed heterogeneous software systems, their communication services and standards, and integration into global information networks. This master’s thesis covers areas ranging from Internet technologies, cloud computing or business document standards and their integration into information systems, through innovative design and implementation of the developed prototype. The work outlines relevant technological principles of B2B document mapping and transformation, based on the research and knowledge acquired throughout the study.\n[1] Philipp Liegl, Business Documents for Inter-Organizational Business Processes, PhD thesis, Technische Universität Wien, Fakultät für Informatik, 2009.\n[2] Patrick Ziegler and Klaus R.

Um den Anforderungen gerecht werden zu können, ist oftmals eine Kooperation von mehreren, unabhängigen und heterogenen Systemen zur Bündelung mehrerer Dienste notwendig.\nDa die Art und Weise der Ausführungen von Diensten von dem zu realisierenden, oftmals komplexen Geschäftsprozess abhängt, ist es sehr wichtig, die einzelnen Aktivitäten eines solchen Prozesses zu koordinieren, um ein gemeinsames Ergebnisunter den teilnehmenden Diensten zu erreichen. Weil die Abarbeitung eines Geschäftsprozesses oft länger dauern kann, ist es außerdem ganz wichtig, Nebenläufigkeit und damit verbesserte Performanz zu gewährleisten, um auch große Benutzerzahlen handhaben zu können. Diese Anforderungen werden im Rahmen von Transaktionsmodellen behandelt.\nIn dieser Diplomarbeit wird deshalb ein Überblick über relevante Teile der Transaktionstheorie gegeben. Das Augenmerk liegt dabei auf offenen geschachtelten Transaktionen, mittels deren Einsatz sehr komplexen Sachverhalten Rechnung getragenwerden kann. Basierend auf der existierenden Transaktionstheorie ist die Untersuchung von drei Transaktionsprotokollen für Web Services zentraler Punkt dieser Arbeit. Alle drei ermöglichen es, mehrere Web Services untereinander zu koordinieren und ein gemeinsames Ergebnis herbeizuführen. Neben einer detaillierten Erklärung der einzelnen Protokolle werden diese hinsichtlich ihrer Eignung für die Abbildung langer Geschäftsprozesse kritisch betrachtet und gegenübergestellt.\nUm den praktischen Einsatz von Transaktionsprotokollen für Web Services zu demonstrieren, wird neben der Vorstellung einiger aktueller Projekte und Produkte der durchgeführte Test einer Demo-Applikation und die dabei gewonnen Eindrücke, die durchaus sehr positiv waren, geschildert.

Also the patterns and technologies for developing and running web applications have changed a lot over time. The World Wide Web has evolved from a collection of linked static documents to a space of countless dynamic, data centric applications. One of the oldest and most popular languages for developing dynamic web applications is PHP. Although nowadays there are proved techniques for developing web applications in PHP, many older PHP web applications are written without the notion of applying well-defined design patterns. Those web applications are hard to understand, maintain, extend as well as hard to migrate to new web platforms. Nowadays many web applications are developed using Model Driven Engineering (MDE) techniques where software systems are described as models and code artifacts are generated out of these models. But often the requirement is not to develop a completely new web application but to capture the functionality of an existing legacy application. As it usually takes a lot of time for humans to understand the source code, it can be helpful to have a tool that analyzes the source artifacts and transforms them into a model on a higher level of abstraction. This process is called reverse engineering. The requirements for such a tool to work is the existence of well-known patterns in the source code, which is typically found in Model-View-Controller (MVC) web applications. In this thesis a reverse engineering process from a legacy PHP web shop application into a model of the Web Modeling Language (WebML), based on static code analysis, is presented. First of all the requirements for the source code are analyzed in order to apply an automatic reverse engineering process on it. The source application is refactored to fulfill these requirements, which leads to a MVC version of the example application. The refactored application is the source for the next step, a code to model transformation into an intermediate model of the MVC web application. The last step is a model to model transformation from the the MVC model into a WebML model. The result is aWebML model that shows the most important structural and behavioral aspects of the example application. The benefit of such a model is that that it provides a realistic documentation of the current state of the application. Whenever the application changes, the process can be repeated so the documentation never gets outdated. It helps humans to understand the connections between different parts of the application and can be used to support refactoring activities or the migration to another platform.\n Download the paper and poster\n","date":1589891871,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891871,"objectID":"97c859b565a0bc71dbc741c6f4115403","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/archive/from-legacy-web-applications-to-webml-models/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:37:51Z","relpermalink":"/master-thesis/archive/from-legacy-web-applications-to-webml-models/","section":"master-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in December 2009.\nIn the last decade the adoption of web applications instead of desktop applications has grown rapidly.

Although these two terms are often used synonymously, there is a clear difference between them. Learning is adapting to a situation whereas transfer is applying this knowledge to similar situations. There are various approaches to measuring learning success or transfer, most of which originate in educational science. In this thesis we consider the special case of innovation courses, where there are various additional requirements that must be met for the measurement. Unfortunately, the existing frameworks are not designed for these requirements and are therefore not sufficient. An innovation course is a long-term course in which employees of various companies are taught and trained in a certain topic. Such an innovation course consists of several modules for which both the measurement of learning success and knowledge transfer for the individual participants must take place in the various modules. To achieve this and to make the measurements repeatable and objective, we have developed a framework for transfer monitoring from university to industry. We use the Design Science Approach to develop the framework. However, the goal is not to create a static artefact that can only be applied to the course of our case study, but to design a framework that is also easily adaptable and applicable in other innovation courses or in a similar environment. To test and improve this framework, we use it in four modules of the DigiTrans 4.0 innovation course. For three of the four modules of our case study, the difference between the knowledge before the module and at the end is statistically signiﬁcant. We also create linear models to explain or predict the transfer. The necessary variables for linear regressions are derived from literature research. The models are created both with and without heteroscedasticity adjustment. The results of the models are slightly different, but show a common trend, which originates from the same background formula. Since these characteristics are known in the literature of knowledge transfer, the framework created is well suited for measuring the transfer.\n","date":1589891870,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891870,"objectID":"3c77f4001562190d87d9b70ed276a11a","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/archive/transfer-monitoring-from-university-to-industry/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:37:50Z","relpermalink":"/master-thesis/archive/transfer-monitoring-from-university-to-industry/","section":"master-thesis","summary":"The measurement of the knowledge change of employees as well as the subsequent transfer within their companies is discussed in this thesis.

Despite their youth, both approaches already show their value to the software engineering community manifold and gain more and more attention as well in other domains. For example, in web engineering, some web modeling methodologies have already started to profit from the ideas of MDE and ASOD. Still, the common drawback of most emerging technologies is the inescapable lack of tool support, being especially true for aspect-oriented modeling languages and web modeling languages.\nRecently, the web modeling language WebML, an academic method that is supported by the commercial tool WebRatio, has been extended with concepts from the aspect-orientation paradigm. The resulting aspectWebML modeling language, allows for separately modeling crosscutting concerns such as customization for context-aware web applications, from the rest of the applications functionality. Currently aspectWebML is supported by a simple tree-based modeling editor built upon the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF), only. While such EMF editors have been around for some time and proved their usefulness, their clumsy handling certainly does not address the modelers‘ needs.\nThe primary objective of this work is to propose an Graphical Integrated Develoment Environment (IDE) for allowing to develop web applications with aspectWebML in the sense of MDE. In this respect, a major focus is placed on integrating views that support the user in modeling and quickly absorbing aspect-orientation-related interconnections between elements, being at the very core of the aspectWebML language. The concepts of Model-driven Development will be extensivley used throughout all phases of this thesis, starting with the IDE’s major graphical editors parts being created with Eclipses Graphical Modeling Framework (GMF) that allows to quickly craft powerful graphical editors on any EMF-based metamodel. Furthermore, some technologies that build the foundation for GMFs success, i.e. EMF and the code generation framework openArchitectureWare (OAW), are to be used in the next step to construct basic model transformation and code generation facilites for aspectWebML that can be easily plugged into the IDE. The ultimate goal is to show how building an integrated toolset for custom metamodels can be done efficiently with current (open source) technologies.\n Download the paper and poster\n","date":1589891869,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891869,"objectID":"a3d362b61e908f1dbb50827a7f32fa29","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/archive/towards-model-driven-web-application-development-with-aspectwebml-an-integrated-graphical-development-environment/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:37:49Z","relpermalink":"/master-thesis/archive/towards-model-driven-web-application-development-with-aspectwebml-an-integrated-graphical-development-environment/","section":"master-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in December 2007.\nModel Driven Engineering (MDE) and Aspect Oriented Software Development (AOSD) are among what is to be said ’the next big thing’.

Representing healthcare information electronically allows to exchange information quickly utilizing all of information technology’s advantages. One of the keys for electronic healthcare information exchange is a common format to represent information, such as it is specified through healthcare standards.\nRegardless of the source of information, there are different possibilities where healthcare information may result into erroneous or faulty information. The source of erroneous information may be physical equipment producing wrong results, as well as a human entering wrong information into an information system. Having healthcare information available electronically, and moreover represented in a common format such as it is specified through healthcare standards, allows the processing of information using healthcare information applications. Therefore, one of the goals of this thesis is to identify different sources in healthcare information processing where erroneous information may occur. Based on these findings, notations are identified that may be used to define constraints. The purpose of constraints is to allow the definition of rules, which may then be applied to healthcare information, in order to discover inconsistent and erroneous parts thereof. Furthermore, different technologies, including hardware and software, are described which may be used to apply constraints.\nWith the necessary theoretical background and technology, a fictional scenario is described. The purpose of the scenario is to illustrate different approaches to define and apply constraints to evaluate the quality and consistency of healthcare information. In particular, three different approaches are implemented and illustrated. It is then shown how constraint notations and the technology to apply constraints may support didactics in the healthcare area. The results found during the implementation and illustration of three different approaches are then evaluated, compared, and described. The findings include characteristics, advantages and disadvantages of each of the approaches taken. It is found that not all constraint notations and technologies are capable to define and apply constraints in order to discover erroneous healthcare information. However, even though certain technologies show limits, they have other advantages such as the configuration of a hardware device instead of creating an entire software application. Finally, the conclusion of this thesis points to further areas where exploratory work is needed, but which has been beyond the scope of this thesis.\n Download the paper and poster\n","date":1589891867,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891867,"objectID":"2fc7d829d0cd76768b79747209411e43","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/archive/constraint-checking-using-db2-purexml-and-datapower-an-evaluation-based-on-the-healthcare-environment/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:37:47Z","relpermalink":"/master-thesis/archive/constraint-checking-using-db2-purexml-and-datapower-an-evaluation-based-on-the-healthcare-environment/","section":"master-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in October 2008.\nThere are a variety of different sources where electronic healthcare information may be produced, such as equipment measuring parameters of the human body or personnel entering patient information into a healthcare information application.","tags":["Finished"],"title":"Constraint Checking using DB2 pureXML and DataPower: An Evaluation based on the Healthcare Environment","type":"master-thesis"},{"authors":["Martin Pessenlehner"],"categories":[],"content":"This work has been finished in March 2010.\nAbstract and paper may be found in our publication database.\nDownload the poster\n","date":1589891867,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891867,"objectID":"6bf174d33b6cdd52a7bec4ddbd0b1b17","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/archive/modelltransformationsanalyse-basierend-auf-petri-netzen/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:37:47Z","relpermalink":"/master-thesis/archive/modelltransformationsanalyse-basierend-auf-petri-netzen/","section":"master-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in March 2010.\nAbstract and paper may be found in our publication database.\nDownload the poster","tags":["Finished"],"title":"Modelltransformationsanalyse basierend auf Petri Netzen","type":"master-thesis"},{"authors":["David Peherstorfer"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1589891866,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891866,"objectID":"3927a504c207faa66464664006a04cd1","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/archive/a-state-of-the-art-comparison-of-smart-contract-platforms/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:37:46Z","relpermalink":"/master-thesis/archive/a-state-of-the-art-comparison-of-smart-contract-platforms/","section":"master-thesis","summary":"","tags":["Finished"],"title":"A State of the Art Comparison of Smart Contract Platforms","type":"master-thesis"},{"authors":["Patrick Neubauer"],"categories":[],"content":"This work has been finished in February 2014.\nWith the introduction of OMG’s Foundational UML (fUML) standard, that precisely defines the execution semantics for a subset of UML, and the conforming virtual machine, completely executable systems can be built and executed with UML. However, the full potential of having executable models has yet to be unleashed. An important aspect that increases the potential of executable models is the ability to re-use existing software components since that reportedly increases the overall quality and productivity of the software development process. Furthermore, large-scale software that is produced nowadays, involves the usage of a high number of existing software components primarily in form of software libraries (i.e., APIs provided for the used programming language).\nThis thesis identified that the fUML standard does not offer a procedure to use software libraries. In fact, creating models that build on top of software libraries is not foreseen in the fUML standard. On the contrary, the standard foresees its extendability through the Foundational Model Library. Yet, doing so requires implementing model libraries that basically mimic the functionality provided by currently existing software libraries. This approach imposes a significant drawback. It requires a huge amount of dedicated joint effort to build a set of libraries having similar functional coverage and sophistication as the existing set of software libraries.\nThe research question of this thesis is as follows. Is the fUML virtual machine extendable, such that it allows the execution of models referencing external software libraries? Within this work, an approach has been elaborated that enables to use external software libraries in fUML models. The applicability of this approach has been shown by implementing a prototypical Integration Layer that is able to integrate Java libraries with the fUML virtual machine such that the modeler can benefit from the advanced and complex functionalities provided by those libraries. This prototype focuses on creating instances of library classes and calling library operations. Moreover, a two-step procedure to make existing libraries available for their usage in fUML models, has been implemented.\nWhile conducting several case studies, experiences have been gained that led to further enhancements of the prototype and to the following conclusion. The fUML virtual machine can be extended, such that it allows the execution of models referencing external libraries. Nevertheless, to broaden the applicability of the implemented prototype, and therefore increase the scope of applicable modeling scenarios, an in-depth investigation on common library use cases and their following implementation is recommended.\nAbstract and paper may be found in our publication database.\nDownload the poster\n","date":1589891866,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891866,"objectID":"3518efe289d621bfc41bfef1087c1121","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/archive/integration-of-external-libraries-into-the-foundational-subset-of-uml/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:37:46Z","relpermalink":"/master-thesis/archive/integration-of-external-libraries-into-the-foundational-subset-of-uml/","section":"master-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in February 2014.\nWith the introduction of OMG’s Foundational UML (fUML) standard, that precisely defines the execution semantics for a subset of UML, and the conforming virtual machine, completely executable systems can be built and executed with UML.","tags":["Finished"],"title":"Integration of External Libraries into the Foundational Subset of UML","type":"master-thesis"},{"authors":["Hannes Obweger"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1589891866,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891866,"objectID":"ff56af8112148592ed27898c192d841f","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/archive/teaching-javascript-to-expert-java-developers/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:37:46Z","relpermalink":"/master-thesis/archive/teaching-javascript-to-expert-java-developers/","section":"master-thesis","summary":"","tags":["Finished"],"title":"Teaching JavaScript to Expert Java Developers","type":"master-thesis"},{"authors":["Philipp Naderer"],"categories":[],"content":"This work has been finished in July 2016.\n","date":1589891865,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891865,"objectID":"adf9e46555e74ad4d1e0b656ee2a629f","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/archive/non-functional-testing-in-cloud-environments/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:37:45Z","relpermalink":"/master-thesis/archive/non-functional-testing-in-cloud-environments/","section":"master-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in July 2016.","tags":["Finished"],"title":"Non-functional Testing in Cloud Environments","type":"master-thesis"},{"authors":["Johannes Murth"],"categories":[],"content":"This work has been finished in December 2009.\nDie Fähigkeit von Software-Entwicklern, zu konkreten Problemstellungen klare und umfassende Modelle zu erstellen, erweist sich als essenzieller Faktor für den Erfolg von Software-Projekten.

Companies can use the Internet for various tasks. One possible application area is the information acquisition. As the Internet provides such a huge amount of information it is necessary to distinguish between relevant and irrelevant data. Web scrapers can be used to gather defined content from the Internet. A lot of scrapers and crawlers are available. Hence we decided to accomplish a case study with a company. We analyze available programs which are applicable in this domain.\nThe company is the leading provider of online gaming entertainment. They offer sports betting, poker, casino games, soft games and skill games. For the sports betting platform they use data about events (fixtures/results) which are partly supplied by extern feed providers. Accordingly, there is a dependency on providers. Another problem is that smaller sports and minor leagues are not covered by the providers. This approach requires cross checks which are manual checks with websites if provider data differs and the definition of a primary source (source which is used in case of different data from providers) have to be done by data input user. Data about fixtures and results should be delivered by a company owned application.\nThis application should be a domain-specific web crawler. It gathers information from well defined sources. This means bwin will not depend on other providers and they can cover more leagues. The coverage of the data feed integration tool will increase. Furthermore, it eliminates the cross checks between different sources. The first aim of this master thesis is to compose a functional specification for the usage of robots to gather event data via Internet and integrate the gathered information into the existing systems. Eight selected web scrapers will be evaluated and checked based on a benchmark catalogue which is created according to the functional specification.

With the usage of this paradigm the software engineering process becomes more model-centric and less code-centric. This means that models become the main artifact in the software development process and therewith the whole software development process relies on these models and their correctness. For this reason the need for executable models that can be tested and validated arose. The Model Driven Architecture (MDA) is the MDD approach developed by the Object Management Group (OMG) that relies on the usage of a bunch of OMG standards. This approach designates the usage of UML to define a platform-independent model of the system that should be developed. The problem is that UML models are not executable because UML has no precise and complete specified semantics. Its semantics is defined informally in English prose and this definition is scattered throughout the standard which is about 1000 pages. Because of this ambiguities arise and models can be interpreted and executed in different ways. This also led to the development of execution tools that are not interoperable because they implement different execution semantics.\n OMG recognized the need for executable models and the corresponding issues with UML and developed a new standard called Semantics of a Foundational Subset of Executable UML Models or foundational UML (fUML) that was released in February 2011. This standard defines the precise execution semantics of a selected subset of UML 2, the so-called foundational UML subset.\n The research question of this thesis is as follows. Is the semantics definition of the fUML standard sound and applicable for building tools that enable the execution of UML activity diagrams? To answer this question, a prototype of a model-interpreter has been developed in this thesis that is able to execute and debug UML models according to the execution semantics defined in the fUML standard. This model-interpreter prototype focuses on executing activity diagrams that model the manipulation of objects and links in a system. Furthermore, the prototype provides reasonable debugging functionality similar to the functionality offered for debugging code like the step-wise execution and the displaying of the debugging progress. The experiences gained during the implementation of the model-interpreter prototype were reflected in order to evaluate the fUML standard itself as well as its applicability. The main conclusion of this evaluation is that the fUML standard is applicable for implementing tools that support the execution of UML activity diagram, but that high efforts are necessary to develop a user-friendly and efficiently usable tool supporting features like the debugging of models or the execution of incomplete models.\nAbstract and paper may be found in our publication database.\nDownload the poster\n","date":1589891862,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891862,"objectID":"0ba881a9eec9837051f8249f77614351","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/archive/breathing-new-life-into-models-an-interpreter-based-approach-for-executing-uml-models/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:37:42Z","relpermalink":"/master-thesis/archive/breathing-new-life-into-models-an-interpreter-based-approach-for-executing-uml-models/","section":"master-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in May 2011.\nOver the past years the development paradigm Model-Driven Development (MDD) gained significant in popularity.

Das Ziel dieses umfangreichen Projekts war die Konzeption, Modellierung und Implementierung einer Web-Anwendung mit Customizationunterstützung, dh. einer Web-Anwendung, die aufgrund mehrerer Kontextfaktoren wie Benutzer, Zeit, Ort, Gerät, etc., mit der Adaptierung ihrer Dienste reagiert. Die Implementierung der Customizationfunktionalität ist allerdings komplex, da sie an vielen Stellen der Web-Anwendung Berücksichtigung finden muss und sich quer durch den Code des Systems zieht. Separation of Concerns ist daher im Sinne der Wartbarkeit, Erweiterbarkeit und Änderbarkeit eines Systems anzustreben.\nIm speziellen Fokus dieser Arbeit stand der anymedia Aspekt von ubiquitären Web-Anwendungen. Die Anpassung der Web-Anwendung an die technischen Kontextfaktoren des Endgeräts unter besonderer Berücksichtigung der verschiedenen Techniken zur Erkennung der Eigenschaften des Endgeräts, wurde untersucht. Anschließend wurden die Adaptierungstechniken für die Anpassung der Inhalte evaluiert und im Rahmen eines praktischen Prototyps umgesetzt.\nDie Adaptierung an das Endgerät ist Teil der Customization der ubiquitären Web-Anwendung und zieht sich somit als Crosscutting Concern durch die gesamte Anwendung. Speziell im Hinblick auf die Endgerätunabhängigkeit gilt es schon von Beginn an genau festzulegen, welche Inhalte wie granular und mit welchen Metainformationen gespeichert werden. Weiters ist es wichtig, im Hinblick auf die nötigen Adaptierungstechniken festzulegen, welche Authoring Methode zum Einsatz kommt. Ebenso notwendig für die Adaptierung ist die Erkennung der Geräteeigenschaften, denn in Abhängigkeit dieser erfolgt die eigentliche Selektion und Aggregation der Inhalte und anschließend die Transformation der Darstellung an die Einschränkungen des Endgeräts.\n Download the paper and poster\n","date":1589891862,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891862,"objectID":"81ec635349a76ccd0bb86076fa92866f","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/archive/ubiquitre-web-anwendungen-entwicklung-endgerteunabhngiger-lsungsanstze/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:37:42Z","relpermalink":"/master-thesis/archive/ubiquitre-web-anwendungen-entwicklung-endgerteunabhngiger-lsungsanstze/","section":"master-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in February 2007.\nUbiquitäre Web-Anwendungen haben das anytime/anywhere/anymedia Paradigma zugrunde liegen, und sollen dem Anwender, egal wann, wo und mit welchem Gerät er diese nutzt, einen individuell abgestimmten und auf die Rahmenbedingungen des Benutzers angepassten Inhalt bieten.","tags":["Finished"],"title":"Ubiquitäre Web-Anwendungen – Entwicklung endgeräteunabhängiger Lösungsansätze","type":"master-thesis"},{"authors":["Roman Mauerhofer"],"categories":[],"content":"This work has been finished in September 2009.\nDie Modellgetriebene Softwareentwicklung ist ein aktueller Trend in der Softwareentwicklung.

Aktuelle Ansätze legen dabei hauptsächlich Wert auf funktionale Aspekte des zu generierenden Codes, z.B. wie aus UML-Diagrammen Java Code generiert werden kann. Jedoch werden Qualitätsaspekte, die nicht aus den technischen Anforderungen hervorgehen, nur selten berücksichtigt. Ein wichtiger Qualitätsaspekt stellt u.a. die Barrierefreiheit von Webseiten dar. Der Gesetzgeber in Österreich verlangt, dass der barrierefreie Zugang zu behördlichen Internetauftritten für Menschen mit besonderen Bedürfnissen bis 1.1.2008 umgesetzt hätte werden sollen. Um die Barrierefreiheit von Web-Anwendungen festzustellen, werden so genannte Web Accessibilty Guidelines (WAG) vorgegeben. Zum Beispiel gibt es von der W3C die WCAG (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines), welche sich bereits als ein Web Accessibility de facto Standard durchgesetzt haben. Um die Konformität mit den oben geforderten rechtlichen Bestimmungen zu erfüllen, müssen öffentliche Internetauftritte den jeweilig geforderten Richtlinien entsprechen. In dieser Diplomarbeit wird nun eruiert, in welcher Weise moderne Komponenten-Frameworks und Code-Generatoren die sich aus den Richtlinien ergebenden Anforderungen erfüllen. Dazu werden WAG (Web Accessibility Guidelines) konforme statische HTML-Seiten als Ausgangspunkt verwendet, welche dann mittels Komponenten-Frameworks und Code-Generatoren dynamisch weiter entwickelt und als Web-Anwendungen abgebildet werden. Das Ergebnis dieses Generierungsprozesses wird schließlich in Form von HTML-Seiten im Browser gerendert. Diese gerenderten Seiten werden mittels WAG-Validatoren (Prüfprogramme für die WAG-Konformität) hinsichtlich zuvor gewählter Richtlinien geprüft. Aus dem Ergebnis dieser Konformitätsprüfung ist ersichtlich, welche Verletzungen der gewählten WAG auftreten und wie gut die jeweiligen Entwicklungstechnologien für die Erstellung von WAG-konformen Web-Anwendungen geeignet sind. Es hat sich gezeigt, dass der generierte Code der evaluierten HTML-Seiten noch mit vielen Barrieren behaftet ist und noch großes Verbesserungspotential bei den eingesetzten Entwicklungswerkzeugen gegeben ist.\n Download the paper and poster\n","date":1589891861,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891861,"objectID":"fcbcef018659be7a88eaff8a2443418d","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/archive/auswirkungen-von-modernen-softwareentwicklungstechniken-auf-die-barrierefreiheit-von-web-anwendungen/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:37:41Z","relpermalink":"/master-thesis/archive/auswirkungen-von-modernen-softwareentwicklungstechniken-auf-die-barrierefreiheit-von-web-anwendungen/","section":"master-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in September 2009.\nDie Modellgetriebene Softwareentwicklung ist ein aktueller Trend in der Softwareentwicklung.

Aus diesem Grund ist zur Auswahl geeigneter Varianten eine adäquate methodische Unterstützung durch Informationssysteme unabdingbar. Besonders schwierig ist der Umgang mit Kundenanforderungen, wenn sie von denen eines durchschnittlichen Benutzers abweichen. Ein Problem, wie es vor allem bei der (Weiter-) Entwicklung von medizinischen Produkten oft der Fall ist. In dieser Domäne resultieren individuelle – vom Durchschnittsbenutzer oft stark abweichende – Anforderungen an ein Produkt meist aufgrund gesundheitlicher Einschränkungen des Endnutzers. Zurzeit ist es nicht möglich, diese individuellen Anforderungen bei der Konfiguration von Varianten zu berücksichtigen. Diese Arbeit beschreibt eine Methode, mittels der Produktvariabilität bewertet und evaluiert werden kann. Zu diesem Zweck werden das House of Quality und Feature Models kombiniert.

Due to the advantages cloud computing has, there is a demand to migrate applications to the cloud. Unfortunately there does not exist general guidelines how to define the required application execution environments and deployment requirements so that they can be interpreted by any arbitrary cloud provider.\nIn the last years, cloud providers came up with approaches to be able to describe cloud resources in form of an interpretable template. Just recently, in November 2013, OASIS published the open standard TOSCA, which aims to unite existing proprietary approaches and standardise them. Approaches following a declarative way of describing orchestrated cloud resources are quite recent and are extended frequently, as it is a promising possibility of illustrating complex dependencies and limitations of computing resources in a way that can be read by human beings as well.\nThis thesis firstly discusses model driven engineering and cloud computing separately and afterwards, how they can be combined. The main aim is to create a model that contains enough information about dependencies, limitations and application specific requirements, which can support the migration of the application to the cloud.\nFurthermore, the master’s thesis proposes a process, which is subdivided into two parts: Deployment and Provisioning. The first step is about creating UML models and refining them with UML extensions (classifiers, profiles and stereotypes), which consists out of cloud computing specific attributes. The second step converts the model into a template, by means of applying model to text transformations, in order to be interpretable and executable by cloud providers.\nExisting solutions only address partial aspects of the whole problem, focusing on other objectives. One of the main goal of this thesis is the creation of a unified and model-based solution, whose processes and tools support the application modeler and make a (semi-)automatic execution of the deployment and provisioning of an application in the cloud possible.\n ","date":1589891860,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891860,"objectID":"bd018900e66d33334fed6eb174432621","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/archive/model-based-deployment-and-provisioning-of-applications-to-the-cloud/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:37:40Z","relpermalink":"/master-thesis/archive/model-based-deployment-and-provisioning-of-applications-to-the-cloud/","section":"master-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in December 2013.\nCloud computing had and still has a major impact on how applications are made accessible for the users.

In the past decade, model-driven software development (MDSD) has become mainstream to tackle these challenges. In MDSD, domain specific modelling languages (DSML) are becoming more and more important. These languages allow to concisely represent all the peculiarities of a given domain in a model. But being so specific, interoperability is needed with standardized modeling languages such as UML, because they offer a more common way of communication between different stakeholders. At the moment, interoperability can only be achieved by manually creating transformations between DSMLs and UML which is a challenging task.\nThis thesis presents a tool named ProfileGen, which tackles this challenge by proposing a semi-automatic approach for generating such transformations needed for interoperability between DSMLs and UML. In particular, a mapping language is presented which allows to manually link DSML elements with UML elements on a high-level of abstraction. From such mappings, a generator framework automatically creates all artifacts needed for interoperability, including transformations from the DSMLs to UML and vice versa, as well as UML profiles for ensuring information loss free transformations .The approach is evaluated by a real-world case study, namely integrating WebML (a DSML for data-intensive Web applications) with UML.\n ","date":1589891860,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891860,"objectID":"ad21f019a25f22808e74af96b2e7325c","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/archive/profilegen-ein-eclipse-plugin-fr-interoperabilitt-zwischen-dsml-und-uml/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:37:40Z","relpermalink":"/master-thesis/archive/profilegen-ein-eclipse-plugin-fr-interoperabilitt-zwischen-dsml-und-uml/","section":"master-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in February 2011.\nCurrent software development projects comprise the development of complex software systems under immense time pressure.

Its purpose is to find a development model, covering all phases of the involved processes and the majority of aspects influencing the design of a web based software product. This knowledge is translated into the implementation of a template framework for the Microsoft Team Foundation Server (TFS). The usage of this template set is demonstrated by documenting the life cycle of a web software project to be carried out.\nIn order to meet this objective, it is necessary to determine the differences between developing classical (desktop-centric) software and applications being accessed via the web, both from a product and process point of view. The first part of this thesis will therefore screen existing literature on this topic to identify established solutions and approaches. Well-known attributes are then combined, distinguishing web engineering from other disciplines, with personal analysis to gather a comprehensive set of peculiarities identifying this field of software development.\nSubsequently this work gives an introduction into common software development paradigms, both heavy weight (such as the Rational Unified Process) and light weight (such as Scrum and Extreme Programming). Those processes are outlined and evaluated against the specific requirements found in the previous chapter. Conclusively, the main objective is to find a single, or a combination of a certain set of paradigms, covering the needs of Web Engineering as complete as possible.\nThe practical part of the thesis capitalizes on the insights retrieved in the theoretical chapters. The ambition is to create a development framework consisting of templates for the Microsoft Team Foundation Server (TFS) reflecting all steps of the software development cycle. The TFS provides source control, data collection, reporting, and project tracking, and so provides a platform for collaborative software development projects. The implemented development framework leverages these features leading to efficient processes and usable work items.

Der modellgetriebene Ansatz ist in der Softwareentwicklung zu einer etablierten und weit verbreiteten Methode geworden.\nAn dem Softwareentwicklungsprozess ist in größeren Softwareprojekten üblicherweise eine Vielzahl an EntwicklerInnen beteiligt.

Für eine erfolgreiche Durchführung eines Softwareprojekts ist daher ein effizientes Änderungs- und Konfigurationsmanagement ausschlaggebend und ermöglicht erst die effektive Zusammenarbeit mehrerer EntwicklerInnen.

Providing access to different hardware features enables a variety of novel input methods. Examples include obtaining user input through hardware accelerometers or cameras. In order to provide these advanced features we implement the SOMA-Framework (SOMAF) as part of this work, which acts as wrapper between the e-learning application and the underlying hardware components. The realization of the concrete features is based on a plug-in system, which enables almost unlimited extension of the SOMA application. Thereby, we use a custom implementation of Java Reflection to guarantee extensibility. The basic idea of our approach is based on Sabine Graf’s work on learning styles. Concerning this topic, we will mainly concentrate on capturing all user input needed for the evaluation of learning styles. Another important aspect is the integration of the e-learning process into social networks. The system will allow users to publish their results online and invite friends to take the same course. We assume this will improve learning motivation significantly. Users can compete and incite each other to enhance their learning progress. Besides the SOMA framework itself, a sample plug-in will be developed as part of this work. For the evaluation of our solution we will provide a sample course that uses this basic plug-in.

Dieser wurde von der Object Management Group im Juni 2003 spezifiziert. Ziel der MDA ist es, technologienunabhängige Spezifikationen zu erstellen, die für automatische Codegenerierung auf unterschiedlichen Plattformen wie .NET, J2EE, oder CORBA genutzt werden können.\nMit dem Einsatz von MDA liegt der Fokus hauptsächlich auf der Modellebene, die eigentliche Programmierung rückt zusehends in den Hintergrund. Der Idealfall wäre eine auf unterschiedlichen Plattformen völlig automatisierte sowie vollständige Codegenerierung aus den UML Modellen. Da dies aber noch nicht der Fall ist, müssen Software Entwickler bis dato auf 2 unterschiedlichen Abstraktions- und Technologieebenen, der Modellebene und der Codeebene, arbeiten.\nBis dato implementieren schon eine geraume Anzahl von Tools die MDA Spezifikation (AndroMDA, ArcStyler, Rational Software Architect etc.). Das in dieser Arbeit untersuchte AndroMDA ist ein Open Source Framework und wurde im März 2003 vorgestellt. Es benutzt zur Codetransformation aus UML-Modellen verschiedene, sogenannte Cartridges1. Mit diesen Cartridges verarbeitet AndroMDA Metamodell-Elemente die durch Stereotypen und Schlüsselwörtern, wie z.B. «Entity» oder «Service» gekennzeichnet werden und generiert daraus Codefragmente. AndroMDA unterstützt derzeit primär die Zielsprachen Java und C#/.NET. Die Codegenerierung wird über Templates gesteuert, so dass jede erdenklich Zielsprache (HTML, PHP etc.) damit realisiert werden kann.\nZiel dieser Magisterarbeit ist es, das MDA Framework „AndroMDA“ anhand einer Beispielanwendung (Onlinebuchhandlung) zu evaluieren. Hierbei soll die Funktionsweise der einzelnen Komponenten, unterstützte Technologien sowie Stärken und Schwächen des Frameworks bezüglich Codegenerierung ermittelt werden. Aus diesen Ergebnissen soll im weiteren Verlauf der Arbeit die Codegenerierungsfunktionalität hinsichtlich möglichst vollständiger Codegenerierung optimiert werden.\nAls Grundlage dieser Untersuchungen, dient das Referenzbeispiel „Onlinebuchhandlung“. Zuerst soll die Anwendung der Onlinebücherei als UML Modell abgebildet und modelliert werden. Im weiteren Verlauf muss das UML Modell an die Erfordernisse AndroMDA’s so angepasst werden (Stereotypen), dass es als Input für die Codegenerierung (Cartridges) dienen kann. Anschließend werden die jeweiligen Codefragmente generiert. Danach soll die Codegenerierungsfunktionalität analysiert und Verbesserungspotential davon abgeleitet werden. Nach diesem Schritt werden ausgewählte Verbesserungsmöglichkeiten bezüglich der Vollständigkeit der Codegenerierung (z.B. mittels Entwicklung eigener oder erweiterte Cartridges) anhand der gleichen Referenzanwendung entwickelt und evaluiert.\n Download the paper and poster\n","date":1589891855,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891855,"objectID":"24d47f4f1cf28bb2fe3175e0138f6be9","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/archive/codegenerierung-mit-andromda/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:37:35Z","relpermalink":"/master-thesis/archive/codegenerierung-mit-andromda/","section":"master-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in October 2006.\nMit der Model Driven Architecture (kurz: MDA) gibt es einen neuen Standard zur generativen Softwareentwicklung.

These data structures are persisted in relational or XML (Extensible Markup Language) databases. In case of new software releases these data structures have to be modified to save new data or adapted data. The usage of a new technology often implies changes in the data structures as well. If changes are made on the data structure, in most of the cases the old data must be migrated to the new data structure to avoid data loss. This process, called information integration, is a time intensive job, and must be done by experts, who create the mapping rules manually and have to take care of the data structure limitations. With schema matching this process can be solved more efficient by schema matching tools build automatically the mapping rules which can be used to transform the data into a new data structure.\nSmartMatcher is a schema matching tool prototype, which has been developed at the Vienna University of Technology. This prototype generates mappings out of a source and target schema with their corresponding training instances. The latest release of the SmartMatcher contains a new internal data structure, which should allow more complex mapping operations in future. The effect of this new data structure regard-ing the quality of mappings has been evaluated in this work. Furthermore, a new feature has been integrated which allows to import existing mappings. With this fea-ture the SmartMatcher will be able to use results from other matching tools to im-prove them. In the past the SmartMatcher was limited to one training instance per schema. Thus, a further feature was implemented, called Multiple Samples. This allows more training instances to be used by the SmartMatcher, and improves the user experience by providing a better clarity of the training instances.\nAbstract and paper may be found in our publication database.\nDownload the poster\n","date":1589891855,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891855,"objectID":"001a28bbc4473171fd5eb2a796bdd1af","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/archive/smartmatching-in-der-praxis-evaluierung-und-erweiterung-eines-forschungsprototyps/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:37:35Z","relpermalink":"/master-thesis/archive/smartmatching-in-der-praxis-evaluierung-und-erweiterung-eines-forschungsprototyps/","section":"master-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in August 2009.\nIn software projects most of the data is saved in a structured way to simplify the usage of it.

Many model transformation languages are available, whereas the languages can be categorized into different approaches. Depending on the particular situation, one model transformation approach might be better suited to accomplish the given task than another approach. Classifications of model transformation languages exist, which also includes a taxonomy of general features a model transformation language may support. Based on this taxonomy, it is possible to compare model transformation approaches in order to find out how suitable they are for a given problem. Like in common object oriented programming approaches, such as Java, there are some particular problems which appear repeatedly. For example, it is often necessary to transform an attribute value in the source model to an object in the target model. For such cases, it should be considered to solve these problems in a generic way. In addition, the generic solutions can be reused in other model transformations.\nIn this thesis, four model transformation languages, namely ATL, SmartQVT, Kermeta and Triple Graph Grammars (TGG) (using MOFLON as transformation tool) are evaluated based on the taxonomy proposed by Czarnecki et al. These languages are chosen, because the represent the state of the art in model transformation. ATL and SmartQVT are hybrid (a mixture of declarative and imperative) languages. More specifically, SmartQVT implements the „operational“ part of the OMG QVT standard. Kermeta acts as example for an imperative language, whereas TTGs represent a declarative approach with a graphical syntax.\nFor the purpose of conducting the evaluation, several model transformation examples are defined and implemented using the languages mentioned above. These examples cover model transformation problems appearing in practice, in order to emphasize the advantages and limitations of the particular language. In the second part of this thesis, Kermeta is used to implement a library which solves common problems appearing in model transformations. This library can then be used in practical transformations for simplifying the development process. Finally, the results of the evaluation are interpreted and discussed, in order to propose guidelines on which model transformation approaches are suitable for which problems.\nKrzysztof Czarnecki and Simon Helsen.

Software models serve not only as documentation or as a rough system overview. They are also the fundament to generate an executable system.\nThe larger the application the more persons are involved in the design and development process. Simultaneous changes on a model are very common. With these concurrent changes conflicts can occur.\nThere is a need of interpersonal communication to solve appearing questions and avoid misunderstandings. Specially in the early stage of software development diversities in interpretation may occur because the semantics of models may be interpreted differently. To avoid such problems the communication channels within the team should be supported as much as possible. With good communication it should be possible to achieve a consolidated solution of the problem in a collaborative way.\nWithin this thesis ways and means are sought to enable interactive model-driven software development with the Eclipse Modeling Framework. It turned out that there are already several approaches for this interactive development method.\nThese budding candidates where reviewed and analyzed. Unfortunately each of the tested systems had some disadvantages or they were not mainly designed for model-driven software development. Using them for serious software development would not have been possible.\nAs soon as the analysis of various existing approaches was finished a list of requirements has been created. The search for a tool that matches the requirements as good as possible and that can be extended easily was started and finished with an acceptable result.\nTherefore the implementation part consists of an extension of a existing tool. The chosen tool is CDO, ”Connected Data Objects“, a plugin for Eclipse. CDO was selected because it is the best match to our requirements and is supported by a very competent development team.

They support several functional areas, like accounting, manufacturing, and sales in form of modules that are integrated by a single database where all business relevant information is stored. In order to guarantee a flawless and productive use of the system, the economic phenomena underlying the business of the company need to be reflected in the user interface as well as the data structure itself. Usually ERP-systems are purchased by customers from vendors in form of standard software. Such software supports a predefined set of functionality and has to be further customized to the specific needs of an enterprise, which is not a trivial task and often leads to additional costs. Furthermore standard software only supports specific processes that are based on best-practice assumptions of the vendors. Therefore adjusting ERP-systems to changed market demands is hard, since they are missing a business semantic base. Often changed business needs can only be represented by drastic changes in the data structure or the code which can lead to inconsistencies.\nThe REAlist project uses a model-driven approach to overcome the aforementioned problems with existing ERP-systems, and enhance their adaptability. Business needs can be represented in an easy and unambiguous way in the form of business models. REAlist uses the Resource-Event-Agent (REA) ontology as business modeling language, since it was initially proposed to support IT-system implementations and is related to data modeling. REA allows the specification of events that have happened or are happening in the near future, resources affected by the events, and agents participating in them. Furthermore policies and commitments can be defined, which are both important concepts for ERP-systems. The underlying database of the REAlist project (REA-DB) is based on REA. Its data structure is generic, meaning that changed business needs (defined with REA concepts) can be saved without changing it. Instead of using the classic class-diagram-like representation of REA, a domain specific language (REA-DSL) is used to simplify the creation of REA business models.\nThe aim of this thesis is to undertake the first steps of the REAlist project and create a mapping from REA-DSL business models to the generic REA-DB. Furthermore user interfaces are (semi-)automatically generated based on the saved models during runtime to reduce the effort that is needed during the customization tasks in existing ERP-systems.\n Download the paper and poster\n","date":1589891851,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891851,"objectID":"d0d1e8fbda00b6ca1e8a2ceb2b1e3f8e","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/archive/business-model-driven-erp-customization/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:37:31Z","relpermalink":"/master-thesis/archive/business-model-driven-erp-customization/","section":"master-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in January 2014.\nEnterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems encompass the administration of all resources that are needed for companies to run their business.

ERP solutions fulfill several tasks in companies, including the management of resources, sales, warehouse, employees, and accounting. Since even small and medium enterprises (SMEs) can gain profits using them, ERP solutions especially for those are developed. The main difference between them is the reduced complexity of ERP software for SMEs. Since about 98% of all Austrian companies have less than 50 employees, the market for appropriate ERP systems is large. Those statistics also apply to the entire European Union. Many SMEs do not work with an ERP system yet, but instead use Microsoft Excel and send business documents via email.\nAnother reason for a basic ERP system is that e-Invoicing is becoming more and more essential for SMEs. Larger enterprises are already using e-Invoicing for many years, but smaller enterprises lack the technical requirements. Most electronic data interchange (EDI) standards are too complex and the software is too expensive. Therefore a cheap and easy to use approach for SMEs to exchange business documents is desirable. The Vienna University of Technology project „E-business Registry Permitting Enterprise Liaisons“ (ERPEL) fulfills those requirements. The main purpose of ERPEL is both to enable business clients to search for companies and their products and services and to facilitate the transmission of documents (like invoices, offers, quotes,…) between different ERP systems. In order to motivate even small companies without any ERP system in use to partake, a basic ERP system is needed. A self-made solution is built especially including messaging, instead of adopting an existing open source ERP system.\nHence, if a new ERP solution for SMEs should be developed, it is beneficial to use and analyze best practices. Those are figured out by comparing existing ERP systems for SMEs. Messaging functionalities (exchange of business documents) are the key to success. Therefore they should be considered in the whole design process.\nAll basic features are described shortly, together with the way they are implemented in different ERP solutions. The focus lies on sale and warehouse management functionalities, due to the requirements of the research project ERPEL. Other features are examined as well, but not in detail. The final artifacts are among other things wireframes, showing the functional requirements for a basic ERP system. The goal is to design a widespread ERP adoption for SMEs, supporting seamless communication between different enterprises.\n ","date":1589891851,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891851,"objectID":"86182c8c98138cdb55e353880bfc1697","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/archive/design-and-conception-of-an-erp-system-for-smes/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:37:31Z","relpermalink":"/master-thesis/archive/design-and-conception-of-an-erp-system-for-smes/","section":"master-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in May 2012.\nIn today’s business world, enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are essential for larger enterprises to conduct their business.

Modellierungssprachen wurden entwickelt um Modelle darzustellen, die eine Basis für die weitere Entwicklung bilden. Die bekannteste Modellierungssprache ist Unified Modeling Language (UML), ein Standard der Object Management Group (OMG). In diesem Zusammenhang stehen auch Ecore Metamodelle, welche der Hauptbestandteil von Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) sind und als vereinfachte UML Klassendiagramme gesehen werden können. Neben den Modellierungssprachen spielen in der modellgetriebenen Softwareentwicklung auch Modelltransformationen eine entscheidende Rolle. Das Ziel einer Modelltransformation ist ein bestimmtes Quellmodell in ein gewünschtes Zielmodell zu transformieren. Eine der bekanntesten regelbasierten Modelltransformationssprachen ist die Atlas Transformation Language (ATL). Oftmals schlagen Transformationen fehl und die Fehlererkennung ist mühsam und langwierig, da diese in der Transformation selbst oder in den Metamodellen liegen können. Ziel dieser Arbeit ist es einen automatisierten Ablauf zu finden, der regelbasierte Transformationen testen kann. Dabei soll ein Tool in Java entwickelt werden, welches auf der Metamodellierungssprache Ecore und regelbasierten Modelltransformationen in ATL aufbaut. Hierbei beschäftigt sich die Diplomarbeit mit mehreren Fragen. Ist es möglich einen White Box Test Ansatz für ATL Transformationen zu finden? Wie können Modelle(Testinstanzen) aus einem Metamodell automatisch generiert werden? Wie hoch ist die Fehlererkennungsrate? Welche Art von Fehlern können bei den Transformationen festgestellt werden? In dieser Arbeit werden zuerst die nötigen Grundlagen wie zum Beispiel Answer Set Programming (ASP) und Testen im Allgemeinen erläutert. Anschließend wird auf die konkrete Implementierung eines möglichen Ansatzes eingegangen. Abschließend wird die Evaluierung des entwickelten Tools anhand der vorhandenen Übungsaufgaben zum Thema Modelltransformationen aus der Lehrveranstaltung “Model Engineering” der Technischen Universität Wien der Jahre 2008 bis 2012 präsentiert und ein Ausblick für weitere Möglichkeiten gegeben.\n ","date":1589891850,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891850,"objectID":"a1985014eae01c47bf9f8f2169bc2304","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/archive/automatisiertes-white-box-testen-von-regel-basierten-modelltransformationen/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:37:30Z","relpermalink":"/master-thesis/archive/automatisiertes-white-box-testen-von-regel-basierten-modelltransformationen/","section":"master-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in September 2013.\nSeit mehreren Jahren ist die modellgetriebene Softwareentwicklung (englisch: Model Driven Engineering (MDE) beziehungsweise Model Driven Software Development (MDSD)) auf dem Vormarsch und Softwaremodelle werden nicht mehr nur für Entwurfszwecke genutzt, sondern sind ein Hauptelement im Software Engineering Prozess geworden.","tags":["Finished"],"title":"Automatisiertes White-box Testen von Regel-basierten Modelltransformationen","type":"master-thesis"},{"authors":["Sebastian Gabmeyer"],"categories":[],"content":"This work has been finished in April 2011.\nSoftware engineering has come a long way in its short history. With the recent advent of modeldriven development, which places models at the center of all development efforts, some of the existing deficiencies of traditional, code-centric software development approaches have been addressed. However, at the same time new problems arose, which require, for example, techniques to describe, control and verify the evolution of models. Drawing from past experiences and findings in the field of code-centric software evolution is only partly feasible due to the inherent graph-based nature of models, which renders the adoption and porting of previously developed solutions for text-based software development impractical.\nThe graph-based nature of models suggests the application of graph transformation-theoretic concepts to models, in order to formally describe their manipulation by means of graph-rewriting rules. Though the concepts and techniques provided by the theory of graph transformation may seem intuitive, the specification of accurate rewriting rules is a non-trivial and time-consuming task, which requires adequate tool support and thorough knowledge of the underlying theory. Unfortunately, due to the heterogeneity of the employed approaches, a tool’s capability to specify graph rewriting rules and the degree of assistance offered for this task is hard to determine without prior investigation. Thus, a survey of existing tools was conducted, which revealed the Operation Recorder as a suitable tooling environment. In contrast to all other surveyed tools, it offers a by-demonstration environment, which allows to showcase the intended transformation instead of requiring its manual construction by means of dedicated transformation languages.\nThe Operation Recorder, however, lacks a concise, formal basis which prevents the verification of its ransformations. Therefore, a framework to describe attributed graphs with inheritance, composition and multiplicities is presented with the aim to embed the Operation Recorder into this framework. For this purpose, a conceptual alignment is pursued which demonstrates the equivalence and interchangeability of the concepts provided by the Operation Recorder and those provided by the theory of graph transformation.\nAbstract and paper may be found in our publication database.\nDownload the poster\n","date":1589891850,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891850,"objectID":"c256029dc5d97797e6ea1197ea142f11","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/archive/formalization-of-the-operation-recorder-based-on-graph-transformation-theory/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:37:30Z","relpermalink":"/master-thesis/archive/formalization-of-the-operation-recorder-based-on-graph-transformation-theory/","section":"master-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in April 2011.\nSoftware engineering has come a long way in its short history.

Hence, domain experts can be confronted with modelling problems that are easily solvable by the means of DSLs but hardly via GPLs.\nSecondly, domain experts may lack IT-training and can therefore be overwhelmed by the task of learning a particular GPL.

Although transformation is the purest form of migration, because the conversion takes place in a 1:1 form, there are also some strong arguments why a transformation could face a lot of difficulties and challenges. The superior problem is that a transformation, regardless of whether code, model or data has to be transformed, is only as good as the tool and the underlying transformation library is. So there are many challenges to overcome, like the deep understanding of the source and target technology, the mostly very complex task of the mapping between them, as well as the financial effort. This master thesis focuses on the architecture and techniques of a source code transformation with Java. Based on an simple transformation Library called SiTra and an already existing PL/1/Cobol to Java Transformer, improvement especially by adding new Java 8 features and adaption to the architecture, should lead to a better performance of the transformation and a better readability and maintainability of transformation code. The findings should result in a library called Java Transformation Library (jTL).\nTo test and demonstrate parts of the jTL, a transformation of PL/I source code to Java source code should serve as examples. There is also a special interest in transforming legacy code to state-of-the-art programming language, since the challenge of migrating over decades growing legacy software application is a well-known problem since many years in industry. A well-designed transformation can be the answer to this problem or at least can act as a main element of source code migration.\nAbstract and paper may be found in our publication database.\n","date":1589891848,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891848,"objectID":"eb623e04acc0b86fc19c1f676fe8024f","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/archive/java-transformation-library-jtl/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:37:28Z","relpermalink":"/master-thesis/archive/java-transformation-library-jtl/","section":"master-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in October 2014.\nTransformation is an important field of software migration and modernization.

Es haben sich bereits sehr viele Technologien etabliert, mit Hilfe derer es möglich ist, Webanwendungen zu entwickeln. Die Anforderungen an solche Webanwendungen sind sehr vielfältig und mit einer oft kürzeren Entwicklungszeit, die für die Erzeugung der Anwendung zur Verfügung steht, geht eine meist höhere Komplexität der benötigten Funktionalität einher.\nUm es den Entwicklern zu ermöglichen, sich mit dem eigentlichen Problem auseinander zu setzen und nicht für jede Webanwendung das Rad neu erfinden zu müssen, werden für die verschiedenen Technologien Frameworks geschaffen, die den Programmierer mit Hilfe integrierter Funktionalitäten bei der Implementierung unterstützen sollen.\nEines dieser Frameworks, das sich erst seit kurzer Zeit im Web etabliert, ist Ruby on Rails. Es bietet Funktionalitäten, die es dem Entwickler ermöglichen rasch einen ersten, funktionstüchtigen Prototyp einer Webanwendung zu generieren, mit Hilfe dessen sofort Feedback vom Benutzer eingeholt werden kann. Wie es bei vielen Anwendungen im Web der Fall ist, basieren auch die Applikationen, die mit Ruby on Rails erstellt werden auf einem relationalen Datenbanksystem. Der Prototyp, der mit Hilfe eines in Rails integrierten Codegenerators erzeugt wird, bietet jedoch nur eingeschränkte Funktionalität und es wäre wünschenswert einerseits diese zu erweitern und andererseits die Anwendung ausgehend von einem Modell, das die Datenbank beschreibt, generieren zu können.\nDiese Arbeit versucht in einem ersten Schritt den von Ruby on Rails bereitgestellten Scaffold-Generator so zu erweitern, dass der Prototyp auch Validierungsfunktionalität beherrscht. Dies geschieht mit Hilfe zweier zusätzlicher Datenbanktabellen, die Regeln für die Validierung bereitstellen sollen. Weiters soll die Abbildung von Beziehungen zwischen Datenbanktabellen automatisch in die Modellklassen der Webanwendung eingebunden werden.\nIm zweiten Schritt wird ein grafischer Editor erstellt, der für die Erstellung von logischen Datenbankmodellen herangezogen werden kann.\nSchließlich soll am Ende ein Framework entstehen, das zuerst zur Modellierung von ER-Diagrammen dient, danach aus dem Modell über einen Zwischenschritt der Codegeneration die Struktur der Datenbank erstellt und zum Abschluss mit Hilfe des erweiterten Ruby-Generators den Prototyp einer datenintensiven Webanwendung erstellt.

As a consequence a sustainable knowledge management and sophisticated tool support are extremely important for every successfully operating company. Within an extremely wide range of tools, Web applications gain more and more importance to meet the constantly increasing requirements. Outstanding benefits are worldwide accessibility and interoperability on a very large scale. Moreover, in many cases no installation on single clients is needed, updates can be provided easily, and centralized data management on the server-side avoids costly synchronizations. These factors lead to reduced costs for the information infrastructure and support the employees to do their work. For example, a constructor of firefighting cars can query the headquarters database on the other side of the world to find out which CAN data (Controller–area network) is needed to configure a specific vehicle.\nBuilding such solutions is not a trivial task and therefore disciplines like Web Engineering and Internet Computing emerged. Furthermore, developers can choose from a wide range of technologies to realize their solutions. Handling these technologies leads to successful development of Web Applications.\nThis master’s thesis describes in detail the solution for a specific problem in the industry, namely a Web application called CORA to manage the CAN-Data for Rosenbauer International AG. According to the company’s it-infrastructure MSSQL Server, IIS, and ASP.NET had been chosen as core technologies. On one hand the .NET framework provides the possibility to develop applications in a rather short time, also known as Rapid Application Development (RAD). On the other hand many RAD-techniques are not applicable on large enterprise solutions where the complexity has to be broken down to several layers. This work presents approaches, patterns and techniques for each layer.\nThe Data Access Layer is responsible for retrieving data and uses Linq to SQL as object relational mapper. In addition the possibilities of model driven development to create the fundamental data manipulation objects will be evaluated. The Business Layer handles the communication between the Data Access Layer and the Presentation Layer and adds business functionality.

Therefore, schema evolution and data migration has played an additional important role in this thesis.\nAll these aspects have been elaborated theoretically and explained practically with the help of CORA.

To enable this, one of the most important factors of software development is the underlying architecture of the software and component reuse.\nAn enterprise application is very valuable for the enterprise. Enterprise applications usually involve persistent data and many people access data concurrently. There is also a rich set of graphical user interfaces to offer the users a convenient way to do their work. In addition, it is also necessary to intergrate other enterprise applications scattered around the enterprise.\nWith the rise of object-oriented thinking, frameworks became more popular and sprout out than never before. A framework is an approach of software reuse and enables developers to establish the software on an abstract layer. On the web there are a lot of frameworks for web development. Current frameworks include Java Server Faces, Struts, Spring, Hibernate, Cocoon, OpenLaszlo, JBPM, Maven and many others. Software developers recognize that due to the use of such frameworks most of the code in an application becomes declarative which enables software companies to react fast to new requirements in their software product.\nTo develop successfull framework-based applications, developers should know what frameworks are and how to deal with them. This is an important part, because the use of frameworks influences the underlying architecture of the application. It depends on the requirements of an application, which set of frameworks will be used. Hence you take a different set of frameworks for a server side application than for a rich internet application (RIA).\nThis diploma thesis gives an introduction to the world of frameworks related to enterprise web application development and how to use and combine them. Therefore, a couple of frameworks will be evaluated by studying their capabilities, each one pursuing different goals.\nThe diploma thesis is attended by a practical example which demonstrates the employment of the frameworks in an enterprise application, and explores their compatibility and practical usability. This practical example uses a set of frameworks to make the software components maintainable, re-useable, exensible, and configurable through declarative programming.\n Download the paper and poster\n","date":1589891845,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891845,"objectID":"c8ebeb01e80226f3968d14f34a6197e7","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/archive/state-of-the-art-in-enterprise-web-application-development/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:37:25Z","relpermalink":"/master-thesis/archive/state-of-the-art-in-enterprise-web-application-development/","section":"master-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in June 2006.\nThe software industry is a very dynamic market that forces software companies to react as fast as possible and to adjust their software products to the actual market requirements.","tags":["Finished"],"title":"State of the Art in Enterprise Web Application Development","type":"master-thesis"},{"authors":["Alexander Bohn"],"categories":[],"content":"This work has been finished in November 2013.\nAbstract and paper may be found in our publication database.\nDownload the poster\n","date":1589891844,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891844,"objectID":"f7fd9dcd0953120c9fbaba58cde74fd8","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/archive/towards-an-understanding-of-the-practical-use-of-uml/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:37:24Z","relpermalink":"/master-thesis/archive/towards-an-understanding-of-the-practical-use-of-uml/","section":"master-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in November 2013.\nAbstract and paper may be found in our publication database.\nDownload the poster","tags":["Finished"],"title":"Towards an Understanding of the practical use of UML","type":"master-thesis"},{"authors":["Petra Brosch"],"categories":[],"content":"This work has been finished in October 2006.\nUbiquitäre Web-Anwendungen haben das anytime/anywhere/anymedia Paradigma zugrunde liegen, und sollen dem Anwender, egal wann, wo und mit welchem Gerät er diese nutzt, einen individuell abgestimmten und auf die Rahmenbedingungen des Benutzers angepassten Inhalt bieten.\nIm Rahmen einer Kooperation von drei Magisterarbeiten [Brosch, Mayer, Weissensteiner] wurde ein ubiquitäres Tourismusinformationssystem entwickelt.

Die Implementierung der Customizationfunktionalität ist allerdings komplex, da sie an vielen Stellen der Web-Anwendung Berücksichtigung finden muss und sich quer durch den Code des Systems zieht.

Die aspektorientierte Programmierung unterstützt die Modularisierung von so genannten Crosscutting Concerns mit Hilfe eines neuen Konzepts, dem Aspekt. Diese Crosscutting Concerns lassen sich mit herkömmlichen Modularisierungsmethoden, die beispielsweise die objektorientierte Programmierung bietet, nicht kapseln, sondern sind über viele Komponenten eines Programms hinweg verteilt. Typische Beispiele für Crosscutting Concerns sind so genannte System-level Concerns wie Logging, Authentifizierung und Fehlerbehandlung. Die Kernfunktionalität eines Systems, so genannte Core Concerns, lassen sich üblicherweise in Klassen der Geschäftslogik kapseln, nicht so die Customizationfunktionalität.

Profiles have been a key enabler for the success of UML by providing a lightweight language-inherent extension mechanism which is expressive enough to cover an important subset of adaptation scenarios. Thus, we believe a similar concept for DSMLs provides an easier extension mechanism that has been so far neglected by current metamodeling tools.\nWith EMF Profiles, users can apply profiles within graphical modeling editors that are created in GMF. Applied stereotypes are visualized using icons that are attached to shapes that represent the model elements to which stereotypes are applied. However, in many scenarios, visualization methods going beyond simple icons are helpful for locating and grasping the applied stereotypes and to allow for more domain-specific decorations according to the domain of the applied profile. For instance, a specific background color or a dedicated shape reflects the meaning of a stereotype application more adequately than a simple icon.\nThis thesis aims at providing decoration methods for applied stereotype in EMF Profiles going beyond simple icons. Therefore, we investigate the decoration facilities in GMF and Graphiti and extend the profile definition language to allow users to define specific decorations for stereotypes. Once a specific decoration is defined, applications of these stereotypes are visualized using the defined decorations in any GMF-based and Graphiti-based modeling editor. The results and benefits of the extensions developed in this thesis are evaluated in the context of a case study. In particular, we will assess how the runtime information of executable models can be visualized appropriately and dynamically updated during the execution with EMF Profiles.\n ","date":1589891843,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891843,"objectID":"51c1e19572ef395406612e379a460ddc","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/archive/advanced-model-decoration-with-emf-profiles/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:37:23Z","relpermalink":"/master-thesis/archive/advanced-model-decoration-with-emf-profiles/","section":"master-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in February 2015.\nEMF Profiles is an adaptation of the well-known UML profile concept to DSMLs.

While model checking is successfully applied for hardware verification, it is not widespreadly used in model–driven engineering (MDE). Thus, we tried to reduce this gap by combining modeling and model checking concepts.\nThis thesis first describes the history and basic idea of both MDE and model checking with a focus on the technologies used in this thesis. Before presenting our new approach, existing solutions are compared. Most approaches propose to extend the Object Constraint Language (OCL) by temporal aspects. This allows to describe the behavior of a software system additionally to various properties of static models. However, one of the main missing features in general seems to be a user–friendly representation of the verification result helpful for debugging. Often, the technical spaces are changed.\nWith our solution we provide (i) a temporal OCL extension based on the Computational Tree Logic (CTL) and (ii) an OCL extension that introduces path selectors to extract interesting system configurations from the state space. Both OCL extensions were formally defined and implemented. We describe systems in terms of state spaces consisting of EMOF–model states and state transitions containing a mapping between model elements of different states. The system behavior is specified using an initial Ecore model and graph transformations based on the Henshin tool2. The approach, however, is designed to be flexible enough to allow an easy integration of any kind of behavior specification as long as a suitable state space can be derived thereof. Our model checking framework is developed with a focus on delivering not only the results, but also making the system behavior leading to the result comprehensible by providing a suitable tool including a web interface.\nThe implementation was evaluated in terms of performance to find out the maximum evaluable model size and query complexity. Further, a qualitative user study was conducted for evaluating the CTL extension and the tool. The results of this study indicate that both the CTL–based extension of OCL as well as the tool are a promising first step to integrate model checking in the MDE life cycle.\nAbstract and paper may be found in our publication database.\nDownload the poster\n","date":1589891843,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891843,"objectID":"6ab8b78a345ecaa9548a8acd73f6acaf","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/archive/towards-software-model-checking-in-the-context-of-model-driven-engineering/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:37:23Z","relpermalink":"/master-thesis/archive/towards-software-model-checking-in-the-context-of-model-driven-engineering/","section":"master-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in March 2014.\nThe aim of this master thesis is to reduce the conceptual gap between software modeling and model checking.

The primary reason for this is the importance of business to business interopeability. A lot of research is done in this area Several transformation techniques exist in the field of MDA which is the model driven architecture as defined by Object Management Group (OMG).\nIn Business Process Modeling many modeling languages such as BPMN, activity diagrams, Event-Driven Process Chains et cetera are used. There is also a certain diversity in transformation techniques such as ATL, QVT or Kermeta. Most model transformation approaches focus on software development, and less in business processes. Therefore some approaches may be more or less suitable for this task than others.\nIn this master thesis, a transformation approach, namely Triple Graph Grammars will be inspected for its suitability in business process model transformation. Event-driven process chains and activity diagrams from UML 2.x are chosen as business process modeling languages because of the wide spread popularity of these languages. Fujaba will be used as transformation tool for its Triple Graph Grammar support and its extendibility.\nIn the thesis the business process modeling languages event-driven process chains and activity diagrams are described. Furthermore, several example models for event-driven process chains and activity diagrams are defined. In the practical part the goal is to develop Fujaba plug-ins for those modeling languages, as well as to define the Triple Graph Grammars rules based on the new plug-ins. The example models will be needed to test if the Triple Graph Grammar rules are intend correctly.\nFujaba is an open source project from the University of Paderborn. Its primary topic is to provide an extendable platform for UML, Story Driven Modeling and Graph Transformation platform with the ability to add plug-ins. In the master thesis this tool is used because of its mature Triple Graph Grammar support Another reason is its extensibility which is useful for creating custom plug-ins for event-driven process chains and activity diagrams.\nThe plug-ins are developed with Java and rely on the meta models of Activity diagrams and Event-driven process chains. The prepared meta models are also used when defining the Triple Graph Grammar rules as initial point. The meta models and the transformation are focused on control flow of business processes, because of its central importance in business process modeling. Organizational flow is also included as a secondary view.\nIn order to make a statement on how suitable the described approach is, a list of criteria is defined. Based on this criteria business process model transformation with triple graph grammars will be evaluated.\n Download the paper and poster\n","date":1589891842,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891842,"objectID":"e2e2cb7295f3a22fd4d3b714bdf1490d","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/archive/on-the-usability-of-triple-graph-grammars-for-the-transformation-business-process-models-an-evaluation-based-on-fujaba/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:37:22Z","relpermalink":"/master-thesis/archive/on-the-usability-of-triple-graph-grammars-for-the-transformation-business-process-models-an-evaluation-based-on-fujaba/","section":"master-thesis","summary":"This work has been finished in January 2008.\nIn recent years the need for business process model transformation has increased.

In order to meet these requirements, these processes tend to rely on Model-Driven-Software development. With growing industrial digitization (Industry 4.0), interfaces between people and network plants are gaining substantial importance. Much is demanded of these HMIs such as intuitivity, ease of use, simplicity and at the same time providing a wealth of information at the right moment to users and allowing fast interaction with other interfaces. Typically, the development of Model-Driven software and development of associated Human-Machine-Interface (HMI) are separated from one another. The HMIs are either developed manually, domain-specific for the application and the underlying model or SCADA/HMI tools are used to generate these HMIs. Although many elements of the model and HMI go hand in hand and much of the model is mapped directly in the HMI, these are developed separately. These circumstances lead to a more complex development and require longer planning phases and therefore increase the costs. In the course on this thesis, a tool supported research will be conducted to provide a basis to easily generate HMIs for any model. AutomationML will be used as an example for demonstration purposes.

With the help of specialized modeling tools developers are able to create and edit models based on their graphical representation. Traditional graphical modeling editors are powerful, heavy weight desktop applications that are strongly tailored towards a particular language and built on top of existing modeling frameworks like the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF). This causes major limitations in terms of re-usability and extensibility. It’s often not possible to develop a graphical language that is supported by multiple modeling tools without major modi\u000ccations and the anguage has to be integrated into each platform/tool separately. Another aspect that has to be considered is the rise of web technologies, and in particular cloud based concepts, that can be observed over the last couple of years. This trend causes a shift in Model-Driven Engineering resulting in an increased interest to migrate existing model editing tools to the web. The motivations driving this shift are twofold: increased usability through the usage of modern UI technology, such as TML5 and CSS, and simpli\u000ced deploy ability via a browser. In addition, this enables new opportunities like cloud-based collaborative modeling tools but at the same time opens new challenges and potential problems. Web-based solutions require a decoupled architecture composed of dedicated client and server artifacts. However due to their monolithic nature current state of the art modeling tools are not suitable for distributed deployment. The development of full- edged graphical modeling tools is a challenging and complex task [15] so re-implementing them on a web-based technology stack is often not feasible. Instead a proper approach to develop and maintain modern web modeling tools whilst reusing well established modeling platforms has to be found.\nThese problems are not only limited to the context of graphical languages but are also applicable to other language development areas. Looking at textual programming languages similar issues have been concluded and led to the creation of\nthe Language Server Protocol (LSP). This e\u000bort e\u000bectively decouples textual language IDE development into a client-server architecture. The client is generic and language-agnostic which means an LSP client can (potentially) connect to\nany number of language-speci\u000cc servers via standardized protocol. Following a similar path for graphical languages seems logical but it’s currently not clear how to properly achieve this. Technically LSP provides a powerful extension mechanism which would allow the implementation of a graphical language server protocol on top of LSP. In practice this approach has some major downsides and might even be insu\u000ecient to cover all common use cases. In order\nto use LSP each graphical language would have to conform to a textual language. Since not all potential graphical languages are or even can be derived from textual artifacts another solution might be preferable.\nIt also has to be considered that the concept of completely language-agnostic clients might not be applicable in this context. Graphical language clients need a lot additional information to properly identify model elements, render their\ngraphical representation and to be able to trigger model modi\u000ccations.\n","date":1589891839,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891839,"objectID":"8393e6d5b9e1d6215dd12b4dda47ae85","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/towards-a-graphical-language-server-protocol-for-modeling-tools/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:37:19Z","relpermalink":"/master-thesis/towards-a-graphical-language-server-protocol-for-modeling-tools/","section":"master-thesis","summary":"The use of graphical concrete syntax is one of the most common approaches to express and visualize the concepts of a modeling language.

Additionally, software providers tend to reduce their release cycles due to increasing volatility of requirements in an agile software development environment. This makes extensive testing of software more and more difficult. Verification is usually based merely on automated tests that mostly neglect the runtime behavior of a system. This might lead to impactful problems in various areas. For instance, imagine driving an “autonomous car”. This car is connected to various external systems, or even other cars, that might determine decisions it takes while driving to defined locations. It is relevant for occupants whether the system behaves as expected. Or imagine living in a so-called “Smart Home”. It is important that the connected distributed devices in the system behave only as intended by the owner. In addition, this should be verifiable.\nIn my master thesis, I want to focus on creating a framework that automates the verification of runtime behavior of a software system. Therefore, it compares UML sequence diagrams created from runtime log traces with existing diagrams that represent the current state of requirements of the system. Additionally, I want to create generic methods for specific tasks in implementing such a framework (like loading models or classifying inconsistencies) that can be reused to facilitate further research in this area.\n","date":1589891838,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891838,"objectID":"08549aba2cfd4d77d7b2858b30e579a1","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/detection-of-inconsistencies-between-software-models-and-executing-software-at-runtime/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:37:18Z","relpermalink":"/master-thesis/detection-of-inconsistencies-between-software-models-and-executing-software-at-runtime/","section":"master-thesis","summary":"Emerging technologies such as self-adaptive software, Internet of Things (IoT) and Distributed Systems (DS) as well as an increasing scalability of software systems complicate predicting whether a software system will behave as expected based on verification of its static properties or not.","tags":["Ongoing"],"title":"Detection of inconsistencies between software models and executing software at runtime","type":"master-thesis"},{"authors":["Laurens Lang"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1589891838,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891838,"objectID":"4c47156d1347de2d261b6441ca92b5bd","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/development-of-a-graphical-dsl-for-manufacturing-environments-empowering-domain-experts-to-model-manufacturing-execution-systems/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:37:18Z","relpermalink":"/master-thesis/development-of-a-graphical-dsl-for-manufacturing-environments-empowering-domain-experts-to-model-manufacturing-execution-systems/","section":"master-thesis","summary":"","tags":["Ongoing"],"title":"Development of a Graphical DSL for Manufacturing Environments.

AML is a standardized neutral, free to use, XML based data exchange format which uses Computer Aided Engineering eXchange (CAEX) as its top-level format. The usage of CAEX is further refined within AML. Due to the restrictions and extensions in the AML specification a valid standard CAEX structure is not necessarily a valid AML CAEX structure. Therefore, validity checks available for standard CAEX are not sufficient for AML CAEX structures. Beside validity to the formal definition of AML another vital aspect for model quality is the definition and assessment of modelling guidelines and software-metrics, which is already widely used in classical software development. Therefore the overall aim of this thesis is to create a validation and assessment framework for AML CAEX models. The framework on the one hand provides a formal way to validate AML CAEX models not only on the CAEX but also on the refined AML CAEX definitions. On the other hand the framework creates a possibility to assess a model based on modelling guidelines and model-metrics (e.g., naming conventions, maximal model depth, etc).\n","date":1589891837,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1589891837,"objectID":"edcbf44c38738d264c1a2374282b33c6","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/validation-and-assessment-of-automationml-models/","publishdate":"2020-05-19T12:37:17Z","relpermalink":"/master-thesis/validation-and-assessment-of-automationml-models/","section":"master-thesis","summary":"It has been recognized that during the construction of industrial pants, which involves various engineering disciplines, the used software tools are often heterogeneous without the possibility to transfer data to the next project phase.","tags":["Ongoing"],"title":"Validation and Assessment of AutomationML Models","type":"master-thesis"},{"authors":["Nina Doschek"],"categories":[],"content":"Graphical modeling languages are one of the most common approaches for model driven software engineering.

LSP provides a very flexible and well-proven architecture for implementing textual editors. It allows to reuse editor implementations for different languages by decoupling editor implementations from language implementations in so-called language servers. Through this decoupling, also Web-based IDEs become easily implementable.\nWouldn’t it be cool to use a similar protocol and architecture for graphical modeling languages, too? Following in the footsteps of LSP, this would make it possible to implement a “generic diagram editor” that talks to a graphical language server, retrieving information on the modeling language such as how nodes are rendered, how they can be connected, or which elements can be created from a palette.\nA protocol-based implementation for graphical editors in the web sounds like an obvious follow-up of LSP. However, diagrams are not the same as source code, they have fundamentally different editing features, such as complex combinations of shapes that can be connected, resized, or nested with drag and drop. To find out what’s possible and what makes sense, we have started the implementation of a proof of concept for such a Graphical Language Server Protocol (GLSP) along with demonstrators for language servers and generic diagram editors.\nThe obvious starting point for this was the open source framework Sprotty, a new graphical framework in the Eclipse ecosystem. It already contains a protocol (an extension to LSP) to synchronize graphs from a server to the client. Therefore, we started to extend Sprotty by new protocol parts, such as editing, a palette concept, and possible node references.\nWe are offering Bachelor’s theses, Master’s theses, as well as internships around this topic.

These models may have partly shared, unique, or interrelated information, requiring model integration. To work faster and in a more parallel way, temporary inconsistencies between multiple models may be accepted. However, shared information only edited by a single team could still be immediately made known globally. The two main approaches to model integration are model virtualization, i.e., deriving all models from a single source of truth and model synchronization, i.e., propagating changes between different materialized models. While model virtualization does not allow temporary inconsistencies between models, model synchronization may require storing duplicate information redundantly, even if only a single team is involved. Thus, this thesis combines model virtualization with model synchronization into a hybrid approach. A new model virtualization approach helps arbitrarily adding or subtracting models from a base model. The base model can be a single model, an intersection or union of multiple models, a modification of another base model, or a model derivation. As we can store arbitrary (user) changes to the base model without affecting it, we allow temporary inconsistencies and arbitrary changes to the base model, e.g., as a result of changing the derivation´s source model. Incompatible changes never require user intervention, but just cause semantic constraint violations in a newly defined synchronization model, which is valid if and only if all inter-model constraints including features derivations are fulfilled. To produce quickfix suggestions in (textual) model editors, optimal model synchronization is regarded as finding an optimal synchronization model. For this optimization, both model finders and heuristic search is employed. Model derivations can be specified using a new basic model derivation language, which includes both derivation and synchronization constraints in a single model. This allows for pure derivation by not editing the derived model as well as pure synchronization by specifying constraints just for inter-model consistency, but not for derivation. This hybrid approach is feasible and can support use cases like editing multiple models simultanously using virtualization. Our proposed model repair does significantly reduce the number of (synchronization) constraint violations and prevent new ones due to improved autocompletion as shown in our evaluation scenarios.","tags":null,"title":"Model Integration by Hybrid Model Virtualization","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Daily at 14.00, live on YouTube, researchers discuss the current situation from a health, scientific, technological, social, economic and legal perspective.

Due to the increase of fake news and hate postings, the obligatory use of \"real names\" has been and still is discussed worldwide. In some countries, a \"clear name\" respectively \"real name\" obligation has been implemented or such laws are in the process of being implemented. One example is South Korea which gained international fame in 2007 as a \"clear name\" obligation has been introduced by law. The law was repealed shortly afterward.  In Germany, the \"Netzwerkdurchsetzungsgesetz 2017\" was passed. In Austria, a draft of the \"Bundesgesetz über Sorgfalt und Verantwortung im Netz\" (SVN-G) was submitted for review in 2019. Newspaper platforms and large corporations such as Twitter or Google would be affected by the obligation to use \"clear names\".

Several national and European institutions, companies, and scientists who are involved in the refugee administration should demonstrate the practicability of the proposed system.

However, even the most extensive Open BIM standard - IFC- does not provide the necessary data structure, in spite of its more than one thousand different types, because its focus is the planning phase. Our approach, SIMULTAN, in contrast to IFC, consists of less than 50 different basic types.

This enables each domain expert to create custom data structures for any specific task, which are automatically compatible with data structures of other stakeholders. In this way, unlike IFC, our data model removes the long wait for the next implementation cycle to be completed by developers. Furthermore, it shortens the training time and facilitates the loss-, corruption-, and conflict-free exchange of information between domain experts, which is a key aspect of BIM.

Another significant advantage of SIMULTAN is its inbuilt separation of responsibilities at the level of the most basic types, which, when combined with secure transaction technologies, can enable safe, effective and easily traceable interaction among stakeholders.","tags":null,"title":"SIMULTAN as a Big-Open-Real-BIM Data Model - Proof of Concept for the Design Phase","type":"publication"},{"authors":["René Lamber","Karl Pinter","Andreas Aigner","Martin Reiterer","Karin Kappel","Thomas Grechenig"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1559692800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1559692800,"objectID":"26ab9d98fbd52ce8584b116b014b2923","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-285310/","publishdate":"2019-06-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-285310/","section":"publication","summary":"The refugee crisis in 2015 was one of the biggest challenges for the European Union. The refugee camps had to face an enormous organization and coordination effort in several Member States. Furthermore, no standardized way for registering and identifying refugees in European refugee camps was present. Each Member State had and still have different IT systems and methods to coordinate refugees in their territory. Hence, the authors already proposed a standardized refugee management system applicable in European refugee camps. This concept suggests the application of QR code bracelets for registering refugees when arriving in front of the camp. This requirement was the source of several discussions about ethical issues that can apply when giving refugees ID bracelets. This paper describes these ethical issues that can arise using such an identification method. With the aid of a quantitative survey, done with refugees and nongovernmental organizations, the authors identified the fundamental issue that causes this dilemma. Furthermore, this paper describes possible solutions which may reduce the negative impact provoked by such identification and registration systems.","tags":null,"title":"Ethical Issues Arising Through Identification and Registration Systems Applied in a European Refugee Camp","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Raoul Vallon","Stefan Strobl","Martin Ras","Mario Bernhart","Thomas Grechenig"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1556928000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1556928000,"objectID":"c6572821a2b2030811b1ecdf9ce09401","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-287271/","publishdate":"2019-05-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-287271/","section":"publication","summary":"Although the software development methodology Kanban, which refers and relates to the concepts and ideas of Lean Manufacturing originating in the Japanese automobile industry, was initially developed and used within distributed teams, correlating research is lacking, incomplete and relatively young as a field.

In the last decade, there has been a strong shift from the disposal of waste to recycling thereof. Within the EU, EU member states are required to establish waste prevention programs through the \"Waste Framework EU Directive\" which attempts to turn the EU into a recycling society. Similar endeavors also exist in other countries and regions. With globalization, the disposal of waste became a lucrative business case, often without transparency whether the waste has been disposed of properly and according to regulations or directives installed by each country. Waste flow management is the basis of sustainable waste prevention and recycling. Short-term solutions and financial profit accelerated malpractice in waste disposal and recycling. The currently used systems cannot track waste across borders in a transparent, but data-protected and tamper-proof way. Therefore, solutions to address these concerns have to be found and implemented. Blockchain enables new approaches, especially in ecosystems with distrust in every participating stakeholder, which is the case in waste flow tracking. We introduce and discuss a novel solution for waste tracking, on the basis of blockchain technology and smart contracts, that fulfills the aforementioned requirements.","tags":null,"title":"Technical Mechanics of a Trans-Border Waste Flow Tracking Solution Based on Blockchain Technology","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robert Bill","Martin Fleck","Javier Troya","Tanja Mayerhofer","Manuel Wimmer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"103c7cc388ab0171aef88c45652f34e3","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-262074/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-262074/","section":"publication","summary":"Many model transformation scenarios require flexible execution strategies as they should produce models with the highest possible quality. At the same time, transformation problems often span a very large search space with respect to possible transformation results. Recently, different proposals for finding good transformation results without enumerating the complete search space have been proposed by using meta-heuristic search algorithms. However, determining the impact of the different kinds of search algorithms, such as local search or global search, on the transformation results is still an open research topic. In this paper, we present an extension to MOMoT, which is a search-based model transformation tool, for supporting not only global searchers for model transformation orchestrations, but also local ones. This leads to a model transformation framework that allows as the first of its kind multi-objective local and global search. By this, the advantages and disadvantages of global and local search for model transformation orchestration can be evaluated. This is done in a case-study-based evaluation, which compares different performance aspects of the local- and global-search algorithms available in MOMoT. Several interesting conclusions have been drawn from the evaluation: (1) local-search algorithms perform reasonable well with respect to both the search exploration and the execution time for small input models, (2) for bigger input models, their execution time can be similar to those of global-search algorithms, but global-search algorithms tend to outperform local-search algorithms in terms of search exploration, (3) evolutionary algorithms show limitations in situations where single changes of the solution can have a significant impact on the solution´s fitness.","tags":null,"title":"A Local and Global Tour on MOMoT","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Manuel Stadler","Raoul Vallon","Martin Pazderka","Thomas Grechenig"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"8c4a51d0c56509d4fe6bcc5e661d06ee","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-287784/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-287784/","section":"publication","summary":"Although initially designed for co-located teams, agile methodologies promise mitigation to the challenges present in distributed software development with their demand for frequent communication.

Although several methods and techniques have been proposed to face this challenge, there is still little evidence on how NFRs are handled in MDD by practitioners. Knowing more about the state of the practice may help researchers to steer their research and practitioners to improve their daily work. Objective: In this paper, we present our findings from an interview-based survey conducted with practitioners working in 18 different companies from 6 European countries. From a practitioner´s point of view, the paper shows what barriers and benefits the management of NFRs as part of the MDD process can bring to companies, how NFRs are supported by MDD approaches, and which strategies are followed when (some) types of NFRs are not supported by MDD approaches. Results: Our study shows that practitioners perceive MDD adoption as a complex process with little to no tool support for NFRs, reporting productivity and maintainability as the types of NFRs expected to be supported when MDD is adopted. But in general, companies adapt MDD to deal with NFRs. When NFRs are not supported, the generated code is sometimes changed manually, thus compromising the maintainability of the software developed. However, the interviewed practitioners claim that the benefits of using MDD outweight the extra effort required by these manual adaptations. Conclusion: Overall, the results indicate that it is important for practitioners to handle NFRs in MDD, but further research is necessary in order to lower the barrier for supporting a broad spectrum of NFRs with MDD. Still, much conceptual and tool implementation work seems to be necessary to lower the barrier of integrating the broad spectrum of NFRs in practice.","tags":null,"title":"Dealing with Non-Functional Requirements in Model-Driven Development: A Survey","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bernhard Wally","Ji\u0026#345;í Vysko\u0026#269;il","Petr Novak","Christian Huemer","Radek Sindelar","P.

The refugee camps located in Europe had to coordinate a large number of refugees. But there was no common refugee IT infrastructure to establish a refugee registration and identification. European Member States had different IT systems and methodologies to register and administrate refugees. This paper describes the requirement areas and architecture for a standardized refugee management system, applicable in the European Union. The requirement areas were evaluated through systematic literature review (including official documents from the European Commission) and interviews with experts. The main focus of this work is the portability and efficient applicability for all Member States. These characteristics should help to react on sudden refugee stream changes in a common way. In the case of refugee stream changes, the local government has to establish a refugee camp on a specific location and to provide a working IT infrastructure. This work proposes a requirement engineering approach for an identification, registration and management system applicable in European refugee camps.","tags":null,"title":"A Hands-on Technology Mix for a European Refugee Management System serving Migrants and Institutions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Raoul Vallon","Paul Spiesberger","Markus Zoffi","Christina Zrelski","Christoph Dräger","Thomas Grechenig"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1541635200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1541635200,"objectID":"ccb656d9539de44fd757420bfbc72aa7","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-278493/","publishdate":"2018-11-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-278493/","section":"publication","summary":"Global software engineering environments feature a remote customer in many of today´s software engineering projects.

Due to the growing interest in digital transformation and Industry 4.0 topics, IoT is becoming more and more important. However, in order to correctly implement IoT concepts that are mostly highly complex, solutions and techniques must be provided to tackle a multitude of challenges such as heterogeneity, collaborative development, reusability of software artifacts, self-adaptation, etc. Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) uses the abstraction power of models to handle the complexity of systems and thus it may act as a key-enabler for IoT systems and applications. Therefore, we present an initial mapping study on the state-of-the-art in the field of MDE4IoT. This study aims to identify to which extent MDE techniques are currently being applied in the field of IoT, and which challenges are addressed.","tags":null,"title":"An Initial Mapping Study on MDE4IoT","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Roberto Rodriguez-Echeverria","Javier Luis Canovas Izquierdo","Jordi Cabot","Manuel Wimmer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1539561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539561600,"objectID":"915a61abe42b5b9e2f053e211cd35fb4","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-271554/","publishdate":"2018-10-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-271554/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"An LSP infrastructure to build EMF language servers for web-deployable model editors","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Federico Ciccozzi","Michalis Famelis","Gertrude Kappel","Leen Lambers","Sebastien Mosser","Richard Paige","Alfonso Pierantonio","Arend Rensink","Rick Salay","Gabriele Taentzer","Antonio Vallecillo","Manuel Wimmer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1539561600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1539561600,"objectID":"5d406867219b9ac68788b1dcabde3e10","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-271586/","publishdate":"2018-10-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-271586/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"How do we teach Modelling and Model-Driven Engineering?

In our work, we address this research gap by the design and evaluation of three interactive visualizations which combine the data from the version control (VCS), the issue tracking (ITS), and the continuous integration (CI) system. After analyzing the information needs of a project team and describing the available data, we selected change impact, code ownership, and activity peaks as our visualization topics. Then, we adapted suitable visualization techniques from the literature to meet our design requirements. After implementation, we evaluated our visualizations by conducting a usability test with ten senior software engineers. On the system usability scale (SUS), our visualizations achieved the rating \"good\" from the participants. A scenario success rate of 88% and the qualitative user feedback has provided evidence for the benefits of visualizing combined data from the VCS, ITS, and CI system.","tags":null,"title":"Combining and Visualizing Time-Oriented Data from the Software Engineering Toolset","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Galina Paskaleva","Sabine Wolny","Thomas Bednar"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1537660800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1537660800,"objectID":"c1c80cc28995d131c3667bba4e23fb9a","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-274757/","publishdate":"2018-09-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-274757/","section":"publication","summary":"The goal of Building Information Modeling (BIM) is the continuous use of digital construction models from the planning stage onwards. The affected processes are iterative and involve multiple stakeholders who work at varying pace and in varying levels of detail. These stakeholders require highly specific tools based on diverging data models. To satisfy all those equirements one of the best known Open BIM implementations - IFC - offers a data model containing more than one thousand different types - from basic to highly specific. Due to its complexity, potential users must undergo prolonged training. The even bigger challenge for IFC, however, is keeping up with the updates of building regulations or with the ever expanding state of the art in simulation tools. Our approach, SIMULTAN, in contrast to IFC, consist of 26 different basic types. They can be combined to increasingly complex models, which can themselves be used as types for other models. This enables each domain expert to create a custom data structure for any specific task, which is automatically compatible with the data structure of any other domain expert using the same basic types. It shortens the training time and facilitates the loss-, corruption-, and conflict-free exchange of information between domain experts, which is a key aspect of BIM. As a use case, we present the calculation of the U-Value of a multi-layered wall. We compare number, complexity and adequacy of the necessary data modelling steps in IFC4 and in SIMULTAN. The result shows that the flexible data model of SIMULTAN can be better adapted to the task.

However, just knowing what happened and why it happened does not use the full potential of the data and is not sufficient anymore. Manufacturers need to know what happens next and what actions to take in order to get optimal results. It is a challenge to develop advanced analytics techniques including machine learning and predictive algorithms to transform data into relevant information for gaining useful insights to take appropriate action. In the proposed research we target new analytic methods and tools that make insights not only more understandable but also actionable by decision makers. The latter requires that the results of data analytics have an immediate effect on the processes of the manufacturer. Thereby, data analytics has the potential to improve industrial processes by reducing maintenance costs, avoiding equipment failures and improving business operations. Accordingly, the overall objective of this project is to develop a set of tools - including algorithms, analytic machinery, planning approaches and visualizations - for industrial process improvements based on data analytics.","tags":null,"title":"Data Analytics for Industrial Process Improvement - A Vision Paper","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Julia Forster","Thomas Bednar","Alexander David","Galina Paskaleva","Sabine Wolny","Thomas Kaufmann","Johannes Nagler"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1531180800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1531180800,"objectID":"16ed63619c674ff7b16fcce9ee62dfaa","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-271949/","publishdate":"2018-07-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-271949/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Energy grid infrastructure limitations as new framework conditions for building developments","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Add your privacy policy here and set draft: false to publish it.

There is no cure, therefore people need to live with that disease for a long time. Suffering from diabetes mellitus means that the insulin regulation inside the body is not working correctly and must therefore be monitored very carefully ending up with documenting the blood glucose level and the complete nutrition intake. This is still very often a paper based and not really motivating or diversified process with the help of so called diabetes diaries. Today's society also delivers mobile solutions even with gamification elements, but the combination of monitoring blood glucose level and a complete independent/not directly related game was not yet the State of The Art focus. As a result, the authors of this publication present a game, where people get benefits from entering their blood glucose measurements and nutrition intake in an included digital diabetes diary. By including 21 people suffering from type 1 or 2 diabetes it was shown, that such a solution poses a motivating aspect in their daily lives and differs from current software solutions. Throughout different iterations, 29 functional requirements were identified and described. Within a five week test phase, the participants played 178 game sessions and entered 1102 diary entries.","tags":null,"title":"DiaBeaThis - A gamified Self-Tracking Portal to Support People Suffering from Diabetes mellitus to control their Blood Glucose Level\"; IEEE 6th International Conference on Serious Games and Applications for Health","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paul Spiesberger","Stefan Kuschnigg","Thomas Grechenig"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1524355200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1524355200,"objectID":"9ee19b85c51a7b56459adb79e2547ed8","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-278491/","publishdate":"2018-04-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-278491/","section":"publication","summary":"This work challenges the fast and dynamic movement of new technologies in developing countries like Mozambique and places itself in the research field of ICT4D.

Cloud modeling languages (CMLs) have been proposed to address the diversity of features provided by cloud computing environments and support different application scenarios, e.g., migrating existing applications to the cloud, developing new cloud applications, or optimizing them. There is, however, still much debate in the research community on what a CML is and what aspects of a cloud application and its target cloud computing environment should be modeled by a CML. Furthermore, the distinction between CMLs on a fine-grained level exposing their modeling concepts is rarely made. In this article, we investigate the diverse features currently provided by existing CMLs. We classify and compare them according to a common framework with the goal to support CSCs in selecting the CML which fits the needs of their application scenario and setting. As a result, not only features of existing CMLs are pointed out for which extensive support is already provided but also in which existing CMLs are deficient, thereby suggesting a research agenda.","tags":null,"title":"A Systematic Review of Cloud Modeling Languages","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christian Huemer","Philipp Liegl","Marco Zapletal"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"f7f1edbf903ab1ab4eeca2861c7b9266","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-276678/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-276678/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Austausch von elektronischen Geschäftsdokumenten","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wael Kessentini","Houari Sahraoui","Manuel Wimmer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"8b15953418a3d8cf95d1e3f6bae5a08e","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-271553/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-271553/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Automated Metamodel/Model Co-Evolution: A Search-Based Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ángel Mora Segura","Juan De Lara","Patrick Neubauer","Manuel Wimmer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"469b6ae3a65785da8f2c335cc9ff7ed9","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-268768/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-268768/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Automated modelling assistance by integrating heterogeneous information sources","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Paolo Ceravolo","Antonio Azzini","Marco Angelini","Tiziana Catarci","Philippe Cudre-Mauroux","Ernesto Damiani","Alexandra Mazak","Maurice van Keulen","Mustafa Jarrar","Giuseppe Santucci","Kai-Uwe Sattler","Manuel Wimmer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"0be92a91266b7f06360ce05d11ba4786","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-270196/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-270196/","section":"publication","summary":"Big Data technology has discarded traditional data modeling approaches as no longer applicable to distributed data processing.

In general, models contain modules, connections, and behavior descriptions of different types.  Integration and interoperability may not only be seen as (goal) states but also as processes.

We evaluate the feasibility of the AML-RTDC approach with a demonstration case about a lab-sized production system and a use case based on real-world requirements.","tags":null,"title":"Model-Based Generation of Runt-Time Data Collection Systems Exploiting AutomationML","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sabine Wolny","Alexandra Mazak","Manuel Wimmer","Rafael Konlechner","Gertrude Kappel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"801dc1baa851aec2a69372d71b379fe2","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-268598/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-268598/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Model-Driven Time-Series Analytics","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Dirk Draheim","Ta´Id Holmes","Manuel Wimmer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"b0a1c583ef74e053186e4b45f5010ea6","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-270970/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-270970/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Multi-Level Model Transformation (Working Group Report)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bernhard Wally"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"4e26fbad9a8ee3c8b7ea23043f61de0c","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-276188/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-276188/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Provisioning for MES and ERP - Support for IEC 62264 and B2MML","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thomas Bednar","Dominik Bothe","Julia Forster","Sara Fritz","Matthias Gladt","Christoph Handler","Nadine Haufe","Martin Hollaus","Thomas Kaufmann","Stefan Jambrich","Lukas Kranzl","Galina Paskaleva","Nikolaus Rab","Johannes M.

However, the expectations of building developers, operators and residents regarding performance (incl. energy cost, comfort, etc.) could not be met. The difficulties in the planning and construction process and the unexpected effects on energy supply systems can generally be traced back to the lack of insight and understanding of complex resource and energy efficient systems and to communication problems among the involved stakeholders. Contents and Objectives Currently, there is a shortage of appropriate tools that support planers during the renovation process of existing buildings or the planning of new buildings. Such tools should enable the development of consistent scenarios encompassing both the energy supply system and the typical behaviour of energy end-consumers. Energy suppliers on the other hand need tools that can take technological innovations in the building sector into account to determine a load and supply behaviour consistent with that of the end-consumers. The project aims to provide support for the optimisation of the planning process both of buildings and of energy supply networks within the context of the entire urban system. Methods The method for classification of energy end-consumer behaviour in an urban environment developed in project Simultan determines the spatial distribution of typical behaviours by means of a survey and by subsequently aggregating the findings according to region, residential unit and net living space area. Significant parameters of the various behaviour types were evaluated and compared within their urban context. Subsequently those parameters were analysed and their significance with regard to the \"resident-sensitive\" modelling of the energy end-consumer in urban areas was determined. This analysis provided the foundation for the definition of multiple development scenarios for the urban energy supply systems considering the potential of building technology. The impact of the various tariff models on the total cost of heat supply for single residential buildings in three categories as well as the resulting designs of new tariff models were tested. The requirement for support of an integral, simultaneous planning process of optimised building complexes resulted in the development of a tool for decision support on the level of a single building as well as on the level of a building complex. The design process was iterative and ran in cooperation with specialist planers in the areas of architecture, building physics and building services. This resulted in the design of data models and algorithms for comparative evaluation and analysis of technical measures for increasing the resiliency and efficiency of buildings while staying within the limits of pre-defined cost parameters. The interactive aspect of the planning process was tested within the context of several scenarios and optimized for efficiency and for compliance with the liability and warranty regulations.  One residential and one office building were the main use cases for evaluating the tool in regard to the design of a ventilation system, the display and editing of geometry, the placement of components, the calculation of various system parameters (e.g. U value, pressure loss, shading, thermal loads, etc.), as well as the translation to external data models. Results The main result of project Simultan is the development of a decision support system for simultaneous integrated multi-disciplinary planning of highly energy efficient building complexes, which can be utilised additionally as an analysis and fine-tuning tool for energy supply network planning. The simulations on an urban level generated as part of the project were used as the basis for the design of multiple urban energy supply network development scenarios. These contributed to the improved understanding of the urban energy landscape and, consequently, to the development of new tariff models serving as additional motivation for finding efficient energy solutions in building development. Novel metrics for detecting malware in networks and a list of corresponding countermeasures were devised in the area of cyber security. The resulting complex informational landscape is presented in a web based information visualisation tool that incorporates multiple levels of detail - from a single building to an entire urban district. Furthermore, a tool for interactive integrated planning was implemented. It uses the geometry as one of the main interfaces for information exchange between different components of the data model belonging to the various stakeholders. Neighbourhood relationships, aggregation, limited-by or contained-in relationships are thus automatically translated into data structures. The tool enables the definition of calculations based on component parameters, network topology, zone, building or building complex groups. Those can be based on elementary mathematical functions, graph evaluations within networks, or on complex web based simulations. The tool uses its own data model. It is a linked hierarchical component collection - a component can have parameters, calculations and sub-components and an arbitrary number of other components can reference each component. The tools offers an upgradable translation service that enables the user to define a mapping between (parts of) this internal data model and (parts of) external data models of varying complexity. This facilitates the communication with external specialized tools. An interface to an individually configurable GIT server allows version control and support of project data managed by multiple stakeholders. Prospects / Suggestions for future research The tools developed in the context of project Simultan have a multitude of interfaces. Their number can be further expanded by implementing current and future communication and data exchange standards - e.g. BIM. This should enable loss- and distortion-free information exchange with other tools, developed for various other aspects of the planning and management process. Another open question is the timely detection and informative display of conflicts (e.g. several users working on the same wall) and the support of a real-time expert solution by providing appropriate procedures, visualisation and management methods. It is one of the most significant aspects of an efficient interactive planning tool.  There are two follow-up projects based on the knowledge gained in project Simultan - one in cooperation with Flughafen Wien Schwechat and a Smart City FFG project. As part of those the interfaces to external tools and the usability of the Simultan tool are being developed further.","tags":null,"title":"SIMULTAN - Simultane Planungsumgebung für Gebäudecluster in resilienten, ressourcen- und höchst energieeffizienten Stadtteilen","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Raoul Vallon","Bernardo José da Silva Estácio","Rafael Prikladnicki","Thomas Grechenig"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1514764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1514764800,"objectID":"b2572b3301750b89fcd6a4c070bc4c66","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-277479/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-277479/","section":"publication","summary":"Context  Developing software in distributed development environments exhibits coordination, control and communication challenges. Agile practices, which demand frequent communication and self-organization between remote sites, are increasingly found in global software development (GSD) to mitigate said challenges.  Objective  We aim to provide detailed insight into what is reported on the successful application of agile practices in GSD from 1999 to 2016 and also identify the most frequently applied agile practices and reported distribution scenarios. We further strive to uncover research opportunities and gaps in the field of agile GSD.  Method  We build our systematic literature review on top of a previous review, which investigated studies published between 1999 and 2009, and extend the review by years 2010-2016, for which we conduct both a quantitative and a qualitative analysis.  Results  Our results show that the majority of the cases studied is global and involves complex distribution scenarios with Scrum or combined Scrum/Extreme Programming being the most used agile methods. Key results include that in contrast to 1999-2009, where four Extreme Programming practices were among the ten most frequently used agile practices, in 2010-2016 Scrum is in the center of agile GSD implementations with eight Scrum-based practices in the top ten agile practices used in GSD.  Conclusion  Agile GSD is a maturing research field with higher quality contributions and a greater variety of publication types and methods from 2010 to 2016 than before from 1999 to 2009. However, researchers need to report full empirical contextual details of their studied cases in order to improve the generalizability of results and allow the future creation of stronger frameworks to drive the implementation of agile practices in GSD.","tags":null,"title":"Systematic Literature Review on Agile Practices in Global Software Development","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"If you want to know how AI can solve the metamodel/model co-evolution problem, take a look at our latest Information and Software Technology paper.\n","date":1514757600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574635488,"objectID":"03cdff93ed4f0440a70f9cfd32373792","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/news/archive/ai-for-model-evolution/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/news/archive/ai-for-model-evolution/","section":"news","summary":"If you want to know how AI can solve the metamodel/model co-evolution problem, take a look at our latest Information and Software Technology paper.","tags":[],"title":"AI for Model Evolution","type":"news"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Alexander Wurl, Andreas Falkner, Alois Haselboeck, Alexandra Mazak, and Simon Sperl have received the Best Student Paper Award for their paper titled Combining Prediction Methods for Hardware Asset Management presented at the 7th International Conference on Data Science, Technology and Applications\n ","date":1514757600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574635488,"objectID":"982272ffb462941f8960e8e463fd3efb","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/news/archive/best-student-award-at-data-2018/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/news/archive/best-student-award-at-data-2018/","section":"news","summary":"Alexander Wurl, Andreas Falkner, Alois Haselboeck, Alexandra Mazak, and Simon Sperl have received the Best Student Paper Award for their paper titled Combining Prediction Methods for Hardware Asset Management presented at the 7th International Conference on Data Science, Technology and Applications","tags":[],"title":"Best Student Award at DATA 2018","type":"news"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Our paper \u0026ldquo;AutomationML, ISA-95 and Others: Rendezvous in the OPC UA Universe\u0026rdquo; has been accepted for presentation at CASE 2018.\n","date":1514757600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1574635488,"objectID":"2fd86e0e0929d659458a02bf4c1851fd","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/news/archive/case-2018-paper-accepted/","publishdate":"2018-01-01T00:00:00+02:00","relpermalink":"/news/archive/case-2018-paper-accepted/","section":"news","summary":"Our paper \u0026ldquo;AutomationML, ISA-95 and Others: Rendezvous in the OPC UA Universe\u0026rdquo; has been accepted for presentation at CASE 2018.","tags":[],"title":"CASE 2018: Paper accepted","type":"news"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"On Friday, November 23rd we celebrate the successful completion of the two-year course DigiTrans 4.0 together with our participants, industrial and research partners at TUtheSky.

Typical maintenance scenarios include multiple branches of code in repositories, which involves dealing with branch-interdependent changes, and aspects in aspect-oriented development, which requires in-depth knowledge of behavior-interdependent changes.  Thus, merging branched files as well as validating the behavior of statically composed code requires developers to conduct exhaustive individual introspection.    In this work we present VirtualEdit for associative, commutative, and invertible model composition. It allows simultaneous editing of multiple model versions or variants through dynamically derived virtual models.  We implemented the approach in terms of an open-source framework that enables multi-version editing and aspect-orientation by selectively focusing on specific parts of code, which are significant for a particular engineering task.    The VirtualEdit framework is evaluated based on its application to the most popular publicly available Xtext-based languages.

In order to achieve that, it is sufficient for them to exchange natural language messages. The message history they generate can be seen as a shared database that can be tapped into by personal assistive systems; moreover, messaging is increasingly used for human-computer communication. However, if natural language understanding is required for such systems to function properly, the cost of developing them is high and only few market players will be able to compete. If, on the other hand, it is possible to mix machine-interpretable data with natural language conversations, assistive or conversational programs may be developed more easily. As a first important challenge, we tackle the problem of negotiating agreements and unambiguously represent what has been agreed upon in a machine-readable form. In this paper, we propose an extension of the Web of Needs, a decentralized, Linked Data based matching and messaging system, to allow conversation partners to produce a mutually agreed-upon RDF dataset.","tags":null,"title":"Agreements in a Decentralized Linked Data Based Messaging System","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Florian Kleedorfer","Christian Huemer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1507766400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1507766400,"objectID":"38ddd37319fdb039132082b0dfd7d967","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-266964/","publishdate":"2017-10-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-266964/","section":"publication","summary":"The level of digitalization within transport companies is much higher than the level of digitalization across organization boundaries.

In this paper, we present our approach for building such an infrastructure using the method of design science.

Based on expert interviews, we argue that the current situation causes frictions that our approach may help reduce, thereby providing the incentive to participate.

An interpreted DSL relies on domain concepts to specify the possible execution states and steps of conforming models, which facilitates the observation and control of the execution using the very same domain concepts. In contrast, a compiled DSL relies on a transformation to an arbitrarily different executable target language, which creates a conceptual and technical gap between the considered domain and the target domain. In this tool demonstration paper, we present the implementation of our approach to supplement a compiled DSL with a feedback manager, which during execution translates execution steps and states of the target model back to the source domain. This enables the development and use of tools such as an omniscient debugger and a trace constructor for debugging compiled models. Our implementation was achieved for the GEMOC Studio, a language and modeling workbench that provides generic model debugging tools for interpreted DSLs. With our approach, these debugging tools can be also used for compiled DSLs. Our demonstration features the definition of a feedback manager for a subset of fUML that compiles to Petri nets.","tags":null,"title":"Domain-Level Debugging for Compiled DSLs with the GEMOC Studio (Tool Demo)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Manuel Wimmer","Petr Novak","Radek Sindelar","Luca Berardinelli","Tanja Mayerhofer","Alexandra Mazak"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1505174400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1505174400,"objectID":"0786f26ba5b3212989487a4cb1ea5f08","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-260888/","publishdate":"2017-09-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-260888/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Cardinality-Based Variability Modeling with AutomationML","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Petr Novak","P.

Furthermore, dealing with process improvements requires to have a clear picture about the status of the currently employed process. This becomes even more challenging with the emergence of Cyber-Physical Production Systems (CPPS). However, CPPS also provide the opportunity to observe the running processes by using concepts from IoT to producing logs for reflecting the events happening in the system during its execution. Therefore, we propose in this paper a fully automated approach for representing operational logs as models which additionally allows analytical means. In particular, we provide a transformation chain which allows the reverse engineering of Markov chains from event logs. The reverse engineered Markov chains allow to abstract the complexity of run-time information as well as to enable what-if analysis whenever improvements are needed by employing current model-based as well as measurement-based technologies.

Based on this preliminary work a new project seeks to include the end user perspective and establish a holistic concept for such an app featuring patients´ opinions by applying an iterative user centred design approach. The authors will interview 20 patients in order to explore their thoughts and opinions, thus derive requirements from interview data, which will then be implemented in a prototype of the system. This project contributes opinions and wishes from a `hard-to-reach´ population. Looking into their beliefs adds to understanding what self-harm recovery entails for patients and what mobile technology, if tailored to the expectations of the end users themselves, can do to support the therapy process. Currently, the authors are recruiting patients and aim to establish ethics approval to work with patients at a regional medical institution. The preliminary work together with therapists is also very important and needs to be combined with the wishes of the target group to get an app, which can cover the whole process for the patients.

Therefore, operating with such properties is normally cumbersome and contrived. This paper shows how both data uncertainty and units can be captured in software models and naturally incorporated into their type systems. In particular, we present extensions of the UML/OCL type Real and define a set of operations on values of these new types. Furthermore, we show how they can be used in software models to carry out computations that consider measurement uncertainty and permit the detection of unit mismatches when trying to operate with their values.","tags":null,"title":"Adding Uncertainty and Units to Quantity Types in Software Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Martin Dietl","Manuel Wimmer","Oliver Alt"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1477353600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1477353600,"objectID":"22425ca5f1f11a5efff6c6c5f885d82e","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-252507/","publishdate":"2016-10-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-252507/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Verfahrenstechnik trifft Systems Engineering - Integration von R\u0026I-Fließschemata in Werkzeuge der Systementwicklung","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tanja Mayerhofer","Manuel Wimmer","Luca Berardinelli","Emanuel Mätzler","Nicole Schmidt"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1475539200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1475539200,"objectID":"16d9437d0e0dae4eed8a9aea2e3490da","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-250919/","publishdate":"2016-10-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-250919/","section":"publication","summary":"AutomationML is an emerging IEC standard for storing and exchanging engineering data among the heterogeneous software tools involved in the engineering of production systems. One important subset of such engineering data is the plant behavior. To make this data exchangeable, AutomationML uses the existing industry data format PLCopen XML. However, at the development stages of production systems, the plant behavior is usually defined using other representation means, such as Gantt charts, impulse diagrams, and sequential function charts. To make such plant behavior models exchangeable, AutomationML introduces the so-called Intermediate Modeling Layer (IML) with corresponding transformation rules to decouple the employed modeling languages from the target format PLCopen XML. However, IML itself as well as the transformations from and to IML are only semi-formally described. This not only hinders the adoption of IML as a common language for representing plant behavior, but also renders impossible the composition of heterogeneous plant behavior models for carrying out integrated analyses of the global plant behavior. In this work, we aim at clarifying syntactical and semantical aspects of IML by proposing a metamodel and operational semantics for IML. This constitutes the first step towards formalizing and validating transformations between behavioral modeling languages currently employed in the production domain (e.g., Gantt charts), IML, and PLCopen XML. Having this foundation, we aim at utilizing IML as the semantic domain for the composition of heterogeneous plant behavior models.","tags":null,"title":"Towards Semantic Integration of Plant Behavior Models with AutomationML´s Intermediate Modeling Layer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Erwan Bousse","Manuel Wimmer","Wieland Schwinger","Elisabeth Kapsammer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1475452800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1475452800,"objectID":"2921c7dca44757796ce0f83e0c7c6db0","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-250917/","publishdate":"2016-10-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-250917/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"On Leveraging Executable Language Engineering for Domain-Specific Transformation Languages","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bader Alkhazi","Terry Ruas","Marouane Kessentini","Manuel Wimmer","William Grosky"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1475366400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1475366400,"objectID":"a7d19102263a3015d239f808460e9fad","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-250920/","publishdate":"2016-10-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-250920/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Automated Refactoring of ATL Model Transformations: A Search-Based Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robert Bill","Martin Gogolla","Manuel Wimmer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1475366400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1475366400,"objectID":"3b5da40480d46780d98d2260510fd7de","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-251188/","publishdate":"2016-10-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-251188/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"On Leveraging UML/OCL for Model Synchronization","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Loli Burgueño","Manuel Wimmer","Antonio Vallecillo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1473724800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1473724800,"objectID":"5a3c8ac70018f3c831fa0f1d9e0a42be","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-249951/","publishdate":"2016-09-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-249951/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Towards Distributed Model Transformations with LinTra","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Florian Kleedorfer","Yana Panchenko","Christina Maria Busch","Christian Huemer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1473638400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1473638400,"objectID":"29c43b67cb48e431036443853713d077","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-266979/","publishdate":"2016-09-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-266979/","section":"publication","summary":"When linked data applications communicate, they commonly use messaging technologies in which the message exchange itself is not represented as linked data, since it takes place on a different architectural level. When a message cannot be verified and traced on the linked data level, trust in data is moved from message originators to service providers. However, there are use cases in which the actual message exchange and its verifiability are of importance.

Engineering such systems requires integrating physical, software, and network aspects. To date, neither a unifying theory nor systematic design methods, techniques and tools exist to meet this challenge. Individual engineering disciplines, such as mechanical, electrical, network and software engineering offer only partial solutions. Multi-Paradigm Modelling (MPM) proposes to model every part and aspect of a system, including development processes, explicitly, at the most appropriate level(s) of abstraction, using the most appropriate modelling formalism(s). Modelling language engineering, including model transformation, and the study of their semantics, are used to realize MPM. MPM is seen as an effective answer to the challenges of designing Cyber-Physical Systems. Research on modelling CPS is typically based on national activities with loose international interaction. To establish an interdisciplinary and inter-institutional platform for scientific information exchange, consensus building, and collaboration, the COST Action MPM4CPS, funded by the EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation, has been initiated. MPM4CPS aims to develop and share foundations, techniques, and tools related to Multi-Paradigm Modelling for Cyber-Physical Systems (MPM4CPS) and to provide educational resources. In this paper we describe the overall MPM4CPS approach and its current status.","tags":null,"title":"MPM4CPS: Multi-Paradigm Modelling for Cyber-Physical Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wael Kessentini","Houari Sahraoui","Manuel Wimmer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1467590400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1467590400,"objectID":"3c11a59818d579b476d3906932342186","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-249211/","publishdate":"2016-07-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-249211/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Automated Metamodel/Model Co-Evolution using a Multi-Objective Optimization Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Martin Fleck","Javier Troya","Manuel Wimmer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1467590400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1467590400,"objectID":"b98d216d000f41ff4a477d1cf913d05e","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-249212/","publishdate":"2016-07-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-249212/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Search-Based Model Transformations with MOMoT","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexander Bergmayr","Hugo Brunelière","Jordi Cabot","Jokin García","Tanja Mayerhofer","Manuel Wimmer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1463356800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1463356800,"objectID":"a1cf09f2898817e420ee56f83715cd9c","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-248177/","publishdate":"2016-05-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-248177/","section":"publication","summary":"Reverse engineering is still a challenging process, notably because of the growing number, heterogeneity, complexity, and size of software applications. While the analysis of their structural elements has been intensively investigated, there is much less work covering the reverse engineering of their behavioral aspects. To further stimulate research on this topic, we propose fREX as an open framework for reverse engineering of executable behaviors from existing software code bases. fREX currently provides model discovery support for behavior embedded in Java code, employs the OMG's fUML standard language as executable pivot format for dynamic analysis, and uses model transformations to bridge Java and fUML. Thus, fREX also aims at contributing to explore the relationship between programming languages (e.g., Java) and executable modeling languages (e.g., fUML). In this paper, we describe the proposed fREX framework and its current reverse engineering support covering some core Java features. In addition we discuss how the framework can be used for performing different kinds of dynamic analysis on existing software, as well as how it could be extended in the future.","tags":null,"title":"fREX: fUML-based Reverse Engineering of Executable Behavior for Software Dynamic Analysis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexander Bergmayr","Uwe Breitenbücher","Oliver Kopp","Manuel Wimmer","Gertrude Kappel","Frank Leymann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1461369600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1461369600,"objectID":"1d61d55fb2f09573c447f543bc6a71c6","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-247893/","publishdate":"2016-04-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-247893/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"From Architecture Modeling to Application Provisioning for the Cloud by Combining UML and TOSCA","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Solmaz Mansour Fallah","Sabine Wolny","Manuel Wimmer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1460419200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1460419200,"objectID":"0ec41831d299860d4e712655f8560e39","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-251003/","publishdate":"2016-04-12T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-251003/","section":"publication","summary":"The current need for product variation inquires a higher orchestration effort in production to be able to produce at the lowest cost per unit. However, flexibility and low cost per unit are conflicting goals. To deal with this challenge, new types of manufacturing systems have been proposed with the rise of information technologies in the area of discrete manufacturing such as Reconfigurable Manufacturing Systems (RMS). Still, high efforts are necessary to implement configuration changes in such systems, which we aim to overcome with a modular Manufacturing Execution System (MES), where functionalities are grouped as reusable blocks provided by a dedicated library. This position paper presents a conceptual framework for modeling MES in terms of the Systems Modeling Language (SysML). The overall goal is to define a model-integrated MES as generic solution in order to ease reconfiguration efforts. By the term model-integrated we mean that models are not only used for the design of MES but also during operation. In this paper, we evaluate if it is possible to represent MES by SysML with a use case of modeling a demonstrator manufacturing cell, which utilizes OPC UA as communication protocol for machine connection as well as for providing a service-oriented layer as connection point for the MES.","tags":null,"title":"Towards model-integrated service-oriented manufacturing execution system","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Martin Fleck","Javier Troya","Manuel Wimmer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1458000000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1458000000,"objectID":"10107f118941dd58f233cec0f3a78f11","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-247954/","publishdate":"2016-03-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-247954/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Towards Generic Modularization Transformations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Sabine Wolny","Manuel Wimmer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1454371200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1454371200,"objectID":"d73eba4bc560f6cdad6c46c7d76a0794","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-252646/","publishdate":"2016-02-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-252646/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Towards a Runtime Model for SysML","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Elena Kornyshova","Geert Poels","Christian Huemer","Isabelle Wattiau","Florian Matthes","Jorge Sanz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"30be36e331183f48554672a7516673e7","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-267106/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-267106/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"18th IEEE Conference on Business Informatics, CBI 2016, Volume 1 - Conference Papers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Elena Kornyshova","Geert Poels","Christian Huemer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"68d3d4acf98d60c8f9994e5ba8fb2026","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-267403/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-267403/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"18th IEEE Conference on Business Informatics, CBI 2016, Volume 2 - Short and Workshop Papers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Loli Burgueño","Manuel Wimmer","Antonio Vallecillo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"e3bec9766be4709f6cbc3ae8349a8b1b","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-249697/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-249697/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A Linda-based Platform for the Parallel Execution of Out-place Model Transformations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Florian Kleedorfer","Christina Maria Busch","Christian Huemer","Christian Pichler"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"ccf0a0c10b32544455cb586caa799de0","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-266970/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-266970/","section":"publication","summary":"Electronic marketplaces are built to resemble real marketplaces structurally.

Agile processes are designed for collocated teams col- laborating closely, which appears incom- patible with DSD and its inherent coor- dination, control, and communication challenges.1 Nonetheless, 82 percent of respondents to VersionOne Inc.´s 10th Annual State of Agile survey, conducted in 2015, said they had at least some dis- tributed teams practicing agile develop- ment, a signi cant rise from only 35 per- cent just three years earlier.2 To gather evidence about the past and current state of research on teams us- ing both agile and distributed develop- ment, three of us conducted a systematic literature review of the topic covering 1999 to 2014. (For the review proto- col, see the Web extra at https://extras .computer.org/extra/mso201606 0106s1.pdf.) We found an increasing in- terest in applying agile practices to DSD from 2004 in the form of anecdotal ex- perience reports and from 2010 in the form of evaluation papers, mainly case studies that indicated a switch to more rigorous research approaches. However, past research seldom fully reported contextual details, omitting information such as team size, thus limiting the results´ generalizability. In response, we created a checklist for fully reporting the empirical context of case studies on agile DSD, as well as general information about projects. (For the checklist, see the Web extra at https://extras.computer.org/extra/mso 2016060106s2.pdf.) Also, although past research reported lessons learned in agile DSD, no one has created a comprehensive framework de- scribing how to apply agile practices to DSD to which both researchers and in- dustrial practitioners can relate.

Alone over 700 citizens experienced severe traumata accompanied with neurological deficits during the Roman-Gaulish confrontations in the Asterix illustrated series. While recovery did not last long in the comic books, real-life traumatic brain injuries pose long-lasting disabilities to patients. One's daily routine is no longer routine, but rather a series of complex tasks which need to be performed in the correct order. Besides experiencing motor deficits and partial loss of executive functioning, activities of daily life become challenging. Hence, brain injury patients have to endure long-lasting, often strenuous rehabilitative sessions. Their brains need to be re-wired, and patients have to be re-enabled to self-reliantly perform activities of daily living. The goal is to come back to a point of prior healthy functioning. This paper introduces a novel technology-enhanced rehabilitation approach with a specific focus on cognitive abilities. The act of autonomously making a cup of coffee serves as an example for a new proposed serious game.

Simulations and models of industrial processes can be utilized in all the phases of an automation system´s life cycle and they can be used for process design as well as for optimal plant operation. Present methods of design and integration of simulations tasks are inefficient and error-prone because almost all pieces of information and knowledge are handled manually. In this chapter, we describe a simulation framework where all configurations, simulation tasks, and scenarios are obtained from a common knowledge base. The knowledge base is implemented utilizing an ontology for defining a data model to represent real-world concepts, different engineering knowledge as well as descriptions and relations to other domains. Ontologies allow the capturing of structural changes in simulations and evolving simulation scenarios more easily than using standard relational databases.

Agile practices can potentially help increase transparency and mitigate communication and coordination issues in these complex environments. While empirical studies in the field exist, most are single-case studies that miss out on the chance to compare different distribution scenarios, which calls for further investigation. We report on results of a four-year exploratory multiple-case study investigating the agile process implementation in three different distribution scenarios: within-city, within-country and within-continent. We purposefully selected the three different cases and found ten common heuristics emerge which are based on empirical evidence in at least two cases as well as four further candidate heuristics that lack evidence in more than one case. In particular, the understanding of and adaptation to each development site's inherent challenges, travelling ambassadors/proxies between sites, and a balanced distribution of decision makers proved to be important heuristics for a successful process implementation.","tags":null,"title":"Ten Heuristics from Applying Agile Practices across Different Distribution Scenarios: A Multiple-Case Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["René Baranyi","Sascha Rainer","Stefan Schlossarek","Nadja Lederer","Thomas Grechenig"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1451606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1451606400,"objectID":"f96e671b35a414ef700803ca93ba9c8b","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-258012/","publishdate":"2016-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-258012/","section":"publication","summary":"Together with elderly people, a system for the notification of medication intake and measuring the blood pressure has been developed.

Thus, being a little bit of a sedentary person makes a whole lot of difference when this behavior turns into a lifestyle. If combined with additional poor habits like imbalanced food intake, little physical activity becomes a number one risk factor in developing chronic diseases later on. What is lacking are motivational concepts and tools that pick up \"active\" as well as \"less active couch potatoes\" with the purpose to prevent serious health consequences by making sport activities more attractive, interactive, fun and engaging. Thus, lowering the barrier of overcoming one´s weaker self is pivotal. In this paper, we propose a novel concept and Android-based prototype of a serious game called Lazarus, which aims to prevent chronic disease by using motivational boosts to enhance physical exercise. 117 people helped gathering basic information for the game and another 10 people evaluated the concept adhering to a User Centered Design. The application takes advantage of an approach to reward physical real-life activity (doing sports) with virtual in-game benefits.","tags":null,"title":"Design of a Serious Game to Increase Physical Activity by Adding Direct Benefits to the Game for Conducting Sport Activities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Johannes Harms","Dominik Seitz","Christoph Wimmer","Karin Kappel","Thomas Grechenig"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1444003200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1444003200,"objectID":"e7fbb7790940e748fc31d8d8073c22a1","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-246351/","publishdate":"2015-10-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-246351/","section":"publication","summary":"Gamification of online surveys has been shown to be effective for improving user experience and data quality.

It presents evaluation results from a case study where an existing survey was gamified using the popular game element of achievement badges. Results show that the badges improved the user experience but did not influence the respondents' behavior. These benefits are similar to related work but have been achieved with a lower effort.

Package management and build systems result in software ecosystems that usually are syntactically and semantically incompatible with each other, although the described software can overlap. There is currently no general way for querying software interrelationships across these different ecosystems. In this paper, we present our approach to combine and consequently query information about software interrelationships across different ecosystems. We propose an ontology for the semantic modeling of the relationships as linked data. Furthermore, we introduce a temporal storage and query model to handle inconsistencies between different data sources. By providing a scalable and extensible architecture to retrieve and process data from multiple repositories, we establish a foundation for ongoing research activities. We evaluated our approach by integrating the data of several ecosystems and demonstrated its usefulness by creating tools for vulnerability notification and license violation detection.","tags":null,"title":"Combining software interrelationship data across heterogeneous software repositories","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexander Bergmayr","Alessandro Rossini","Nicolas Ferry","Geir Horn","Leire Orue-Echevarria","Arnor Solberg","Manuel Wimmer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1443484800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1443484800,"objectID":"4f73a7a11d6699b6e5affe7666fc82dd","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-240818/","publishdate":"2015-09-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-240818/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"The Evolution of CloudML and its Manifestations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robert Bill","Manuel Wimmer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1443398400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1443398400,"objectID":"bd261cf5d435b1c34b8ea8c942269541","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-240819/","publishdate":"2015-09-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-240819/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Programming against Multi-Version Metamodels: A Model Differencing and Virtualization Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Manuel Wimmer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1443398400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1443398400,"objectID":"0a0777184dd72e017f2412ee4634a99a","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-242094/","publishdate":"2015-09-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-242094/","section":"publication","summary":"Huge efforts have been invested in the last decade concerning the establishment of dedicated analysis methods and techniques for model transformations.

While such DSLs are well adopted and flexible, they miss modern DSL editor functionality. Moreover, since XML is primarily designed as a machine-processible format, artifacts defined with XML-based DSLs lack comprehensibility and, therefore, maintainability. In order to tackle these shortcomings, we propose a bridge between the XML Schema Definition (XSD) language and text-based metamodeling languages. This bridge exploits existing seams between the technical spaces XMLware, modelware, and grammarware as well as closes identified gaps. The resulting approach is able to generate Xtext-based editors from XSDs providing powerful editor functionality, customization options for the textual concrete syntax style, and round-trip transformations enabling the exchange of data between the involved technical spaces. We evaluate our approach by a case study on TOSCA, which is an XML-based standard for defining Cloud deployments. The results show that our approach enables bridging XMLware with modelware and grammarware in several ways going beyond existing approaches and allows the automated generation of editors that are at least equivalent to editors manually built for XML-based languages.","tags":null,"title":"XMLText: From XML Schema to Xtext","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thomas Grechenig","Christian Schanes"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1442880000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1442880000,"objectID":"d57fd72a49e94fae9adefd70dc4587ed","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-246600/","publishdate":"2015-09-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-246600/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Ein realer Cyber-Angriff und seine Abwehr: Struktur und Live-Demo","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Martin Wischenbart","Sergio Firmenich","Gustavo Rossi","Manuel Wimmer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1442620800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1442620800,"objectID":"8c2d0a9afec9278efbab676ce4b2905b","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-240150/","publishdate":"2015-09-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-240150/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Recommender Systems for the People - Enhancing Personalization in Web Augmentation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Johannes Harms","Stefan Biegler","Christoph Wimmer","Karin Kappel","Thomas Grechenig"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1442188800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1442188800,"objectID":"4f710579c2e39c94e64bf931ce02cad3","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-246366/","publishdate":"2015-09-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-246366/","section":"publication","summary":"Online surveys are an important means of data collection in marketing and research, but conventional survey designs are often perceived as dull and unengaging, resulting in negative respondent behavior.

We are using Retail-H as the reference framework for building a retail information system (RIS). Our main contribution is the prototypical implementation of a domain agnostic REA engine that can be loaded at runtime with domain specific business models-these models can further be manipulated at runtime. On that basis we have exemplarily modeled main concepts of Retail-H in REA.

Therefore, the risk increases that VoIP systems get attacked by hackers. In order to effectively protect VoIP users from misuse, researchers use, e.g., honeynets to capture and analyze VoIP attacks occurring in the Internet. Global VoIP security threats are analyzed by studying several millions of real-world attacks collected in independent VoIP honeynet solutions with different capture mechanisms over a long period of time. Due to the validation of results from several honeynet designs we have achieved a unique, much broader view on large scale attacks. The results show similar attacker behavior, confirm previous assumptions about attacks and present new insights in large scale VoIP attacks, e.g., for toll fraud.","tags":null,"title":"Global VoIP Security Threats - Large Scale Validation Based on Independent Honeynets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christof Kier","Gerald Madlmayr","Alexander Nawratil","Michael Schafferer","Christian Schanes","Thomas Grechenig"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1431907200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1431907200,"objectID":"fb3321506ef7841b6c221afaf31e7671","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-246254/","publishdate":"2015-05-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-246254/","section":"publication","summary":"As payment cards and mobile devices are equipped with Near Field Communication (NFC) technology, electronic payment transactions at physical Point of Sale (POS) environments are changing. Payment transactions do not require the customer to insert their card into a slot of the payment terminal. The customer is able to simply swipe the payment card or mobile phone in front of a dedicated zone of the terminal to initiate a payment transaction. Secure Elements (SEs) in mobile phones and payment cards with NFC should keep sensitive application data in a save place to protect it from abuse by attackers. Although hardware and the operating system of such a chip has to go through an intensive process of security testing, the current integration of such a chip in mobile phones easily allows attackers to access the information stored. In the following paper we present the implementation of two different proof-of-concept attacks. Out of the analysis of the attack scenarios, we propose various starting points for the forensic analysis in order to detect such fraudulent transactions.

This study aims to address the identified research gap and drafts a lean-agile process model that can compete with the requirements of today´s market. Our model ALP-mobile, an agile and lean process for mobile app development, combines elements of Scrum, Kanban and eXtreme Programming (XP). We drafted our model based on previous work and pilot interviews.

Such collaborations lead to inter-organizational business processes that may be commonly supported through the exchange of electronic data interchange (EDI) messages (e.g., electronic purchase orders, invoices etc.). Despite the appearance of XML, traditional approaches to EDI, such as EDIFACT and ANSI X.12, still play an overwhelmingly dominant role. However, such traditional EDI standards lack a notion of process. In other words, the exchanged business documents are typically not embedded in the context of other exchanged business documents. This has two shortcomings: (1) the inability to apply proven business process management (BPM) methods, including process mining techniques, in such settings; and (2) the unavailability of systematic approaches to business intelligence (BI) using information from exchanged EDI messages. In this article, we present the EDImine Framework for enabling (1) the application of process mining techniques in the field of EDI-supported inter-organizational business processes, and (2) for supporting inter-organizational performance evaluation using business information from EDI messages, event logs and process models. As an enabling technology, we present a method for the semantic preprocessing of EDIFACT messages to exploit this potentially rich source of information by applying state of the art BPM and BI techniques. We show the applicability of our approach by means of a case study based on real-world EDI data of a German consumer goods manufacturing company.","tags":null,"title":"Analyzing inter-organizational business processes.

In this paper, we investigate how performance engineers can identify three different classes of externally-visible performance problems (global delays, partial delays, periodic delays) from concrete traces. We develop a simulation model based on a taxonomy of root causes in server performance degradation. Within an experimental setup, we obtain results through synthetic monitoring of a target Web service, and observe changes in Web performance over time through exploratory visual analysis and changepoint detection.

Due to the heterogeneity of engineering data, the integration of the tools and data are time-consuming and error-prone tasks nowadays. The key goal of this article is to provide an effective and efficient integration of heterogeneous data sources and tools as a knowledge basis to support dynamic simulation for industrial plants. The integrated knowledge is utilized both (i) in the design phase of simulation models for defining structure and interfaces of the models and (ii) in the runtime phase of industrial systems for model-driven configuration of the integrated environment. Reaching such goals with a manual approach or point-to-point integration is not beneficial as it may be possible for a few tools and data sources, but quickly gets very complex. A growing number of elements increases the risk of errors and the effort needed for integration. The proposed solution is based on a specification of a common data model to represent engineering knowledge and a service-oriented tool integration with the Engineering Service Bus. Engineering knowledge is integrated in a knowledge base implemented with ontologies in Web Ontology Language -- Description Logic (OWL-DL). The proposed approach is demonstrated and evaluated on an educational hydraulic system. Major results of the article are: (i) a data model to represent engineering knowledge for dynamic industrial systems, (ii) the integration platform that, based on this model, integrates the tools for system design and runtime, and (iii) basic design-time and runtime processes for the integrated industrial simulations.","tags":null,"title":"Integrating Heterogeneous Engineering Knowledge and Tools for Effi cient Industrial Simulation Model Support","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Worarat Krathu","Christian Pichler","Guohui Xiao","Hannes Werthner","Julia Neidhardt","Marco Zapletal","Christian Huemer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"d4a96115f2e982f77af55fa317e824cb","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-230691/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-230691/","section":"publication","summary":"Inter-organizational systems form the basis for successful business collaboration in the Internet and B2B e-commerce era. To properly design and manage such systems one needs to understand the structure and dynamics of the relationships between organizations. The evaluation of such inter-organizational relationships (IORs) is normally conducted using \"success factors\". These are often referred to as constructs, such as trust and information sharing. In strategic management and performance analysis, different methods are employed for evaluating business performance and strategies, such as the Balanced Scorecard (BSC) method. The BSC utilizes success factors for measuring and monitoring IORs against business strategies. For these reasons, a thorough understanding of success factors, the relationships between them, as well as their relationship to business strategies is required. In other words, understanding success factors allows strategists deriving measurements for success factors as well as aligning these success factors with business strategies. This underpins nowadays close relationship between business strategy, IORs and their realization by means of inter-organizational systems. In this paper, we present (1) a systematic literature review studying success factors and their impact on IORs as well as (2) an analysis of the results found. The review is based on 177 publications, published between 2000 and 2012, dealing with factors influencing IORs. The work presented provides an overview on success factors, influencing relationships between success factors, as well as their influence on the success of IORs. The work is somehow \"meta-empirical\" as it only looks at published studies and not on own cases. Consequently, it is based on the assumption that studies in scientific literature represent the real-world. The constructs and relationships found in the review are grouped based on their scope and summarized in a cause and effect model. The grouping of constructs results in five groups including Relationship Orientation, Relational Norm, Relational Capital, Atmosphere, and Others. Since the cause and effect model represents a directed graph, different network analysis methods may be applied for analyzing the model. In particular, an in- and out-degree analysis is applied on the cause and effect model for detecting the most influencing as well as the most influenced success factors.","tags":null,"title":"Inter-organizational success factors: a cause and effect model","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hartmut Erben","Robert Galler","Thomas Grechenig"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1420070400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1420070400,"objectID":"a7e12fccf5f79c3c74b0be30258110fb","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-258000/","publishdate":"2015-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-258000/","section":"publication","summary":"In order to achieve higher utilisation rates for the material excavated from underground construction sites, one of the main objectives is efficient, digital processing of available data on material, mass and time parameters for the mined rock.

Using UML, it introduces basic modeling concepts in a highly precise manner, while refraining from the interpretation of rare special cases.  After a brief explanation of why modeling is an indispensable part of software development, the authors introduce the individual diagram types of UML (the class and object diagram, the sequence diagram, the state machine diagram, the activity diagram, and the use case diagram), as well as their interrelationships, in a step-by-step manner. The topics covered include not only the syntax and the semantics of the individual language elements, but also pragmatic aspects, i.e., how to use them wisely at various stages in the software development process. To this end, the work is complemented with examples that were carefully selected for their educational and illustrative value.  Overall, the book provides a solid foundation and deeper understanding of the most important object-oriented modeling concepts and their application in software development.

Today's modeling tools offer profiles specific to platforms, such as Java, as they facilitate model-based engineering approaches. However, at the modeling level, the set of available profiles is considerably smaller compared to the number of existing Java libraries using annotations at the programming level. This is because an effective mapping between Java and UML to generate profiles from annotation-based libraries is missing. In this paper, we present JUMP to overcome this limitation, thereby continuing existing mapping efforts by emphasizing on annotations and profiles. We demonstrate the practical value of JUMP by contributing profiles that facilitate reverse-engineering and forward-engineering scenarios for the Java platform. The evaluation of JUMP shows that profiles can be automatically generated from Java libraries exhibiting equal or even improved quality compared to profiles currently used in practice.","tags":null,"title":"JUMP-From Java Annotations to UML Profiles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Loli Burgueño","Eugene Syriani","Manuel Wimmer","Jeff Gray","Antonio Vallecillo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1410825600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1410825600,"objectID":"0001b42a6ccfbe27ba5ec536fa893ee0","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-230124/","publishdate":"2014-09-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-230124/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Primitive Operators for the Concurrent Execution of Model Transformations Based on LinTra","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robert Bill","Sebastian Gabmeyer","Petra Kaufmann","Martina Seidl"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1410739200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1410739200,"objectID":"2ef3d8475006d936396ae59a1d84c27f","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-233360/","publishdate":"2014-09-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-233360/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Model Checking of CTL-Extended OCL Specifications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bart Meyers","Romuald Deshayes","Levi Lucio","Eugene Syriani","Manuel Wimmer","Hans Vangheluwe"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1410739200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1410739200,"objectID":"f94f2e4148be3b69881c8f94f5221d57","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-230122/","publishdate":"2014-09-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-230122/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"ProMoBox: A Framework for Generating Domain-Specific Property Languages","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Martin Brüggemann","Raoul Vallon","Aykut Parlak","Thomas Grechenig"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1409270400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1409270400,"objectID":"68d37f80fac375f22e47851d53aab9da","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-235973/","publishdate":"2014-08-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-235973/","section":"publication","summary":"Our experience with email-based marketing campaigns (or short: \"Microservices\") showed that they are an intersecting set of a) projects and processes and b) technology and creativity.

They are necessary for advanced process control. Since a design phase of simulation models is time-consuming and error-prone, this paper proposes a method for the systematic and semi-automated design of simulation models. It is intended mainly for signal-oriented simulators such as MATLAB-Simulink. The method presumes that large-scale industrial systems consist of subsystems, whose behavior is known. The task for the proposed approach is to create a simulation model from atomic simulation blocks approximating system components. The proposed solution utilizes the bond graph theory in a non-traditional way. Compared to the classical use of bond graphs, the proposed method does not create simulations from scratch, but it re-uses existing simulation components. It extends bond graphs with a concept of component implementations and annotations of their interfaces. Thus, models are assembled from atomic component implementations, whose selection is done by the proposed method for each node of the system topology.","tags":null,"title":"Component-Based Design of Simulation Models Utilizing Bond-Graph Theory","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bernhard Isemann","Markus Gruber","Janki Grünberger","Christian Schanes","Thomas Grechenig"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1406678400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1406678400,"objectID":"c17bb17316e6bb8b039f03c5265d75dd","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-235994/","publishdate":"2014-07-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-235994/","section":"publication","summary":"Cities are facing an increasing number of bicycles being used by urban citizen and the need of monitoring and man- aging this type of traffic becomes part of municipality and city administration.

The intended use of concepts has a great impact on their interpretation. Therefore, we assume that meaning interpretation involves more than merely identifying the semantics of assumptions explicitly expressed by model theory-based techniques, since meaning depends on both semantics and pragmatics.

Current approaches for re-establishing conformance relationships are often (i) deeply woven into specific tools to record changes and to derive resolutions, or (ii) require extensive user effort to guide the resolution process, and (iii) the output of these approaches usually is one single solution, whereas alternative solutions remain unexplored. To allow for exploring a broader solution space independent of specific tools and to avoid extensive user involvement by utilizing predefined repair actions, we propose a logic programming approach called CARE, for accomplishing multiple solutions. In particular, CARE is based on a formalization of the ontological conformance relationship as constraints, accompanying repair actions for counter-acting constraint violations, as well as quality criteria for ranking the solutions.

Because universities - in contrast to enterprises - have little experience in implementing and operating such systems, it seems to be worth while to examine the essentials of organizational information systems basic- ally.

Like any other software, transformations are not resilient to change. As changes to transformations can invalidate previously produced models, these changes need to be reflected on existing models. Currently, revised out-place transformations are re-executed entirely to achieve this co-evolution task. However, this induces an unnecessary overhead, particularly when computation-intensive transformations are marginally revised, and if existing models have undergone updates prior the re-execution, these updates get discarded in the newly produced models.  To overcome this co-evolution challenge, our idea is to infer from evolved out-place transformations patch transformations that propagate changes to existing models by re-executing solely the affected parts based on an in-place execution strategy. Thereby, existing models are only updated by a patch instead of newly produced.

The intelligent control techniques, which are based on approaches from diverse disciplines including statistics, artificial intelligence or signal processing, have been widely used during the last years and their benefits have been proved. They cannot be developed and tested without simulation models and access to online and historical data. This article proposes a platform for the integration of simulations and industrial SCADA systems supporting complex data access and simulation code re-use. The idea of the presented framework is to connect simulations, data sources, optimizers, other calculations and SCADA systems into one integrated environment seamlessly. A technical level of the framework provides integration of stakeholders and a semantic level captures engineering knowledge in inter-mapped ontologies and configures the technical level, which is often called model-driven configuration. The semantic level utilizes a formal model implemented as set of ontologies. The major contribution of the article are the layered model of the integration architecture and formulation of the integration requirements in the industrial automation domain. The proposed solution has been implemented and tested on a software prototype level. It is demonstrated on two use-cases covering both design and integration of simulation models from the industrial perspective. The proposed architecture is intended to be as general as possible, however it has been tested on signal-oriented simulators only. It is the main limitation of this contribution and it should be addressed in upcoming work.","tags":null,"title":"Integration Framework for Simulations and SCADA Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stefan Sauer","Manuel Wimmer","Marcela Genero","Shaz Qadeer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"2f10b883c41582c2935a0318d82895fb","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-236402/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-236402/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Joint Proceedings of MODELS 2014 Poster Session and the ACM Student Research Competition (SRC)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Robert Bill","Sebastian Gabmeyer","Petra Kaufmann","Martina Seidl"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"bb1801bf613600ebe81f11fb724baf08","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-234915/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-234915/","section":"publication","summary":"We present the model checker MocOCL, a tool for model checking software models.

The large scale of the internet has offered unique economic opportunities by enabling the ability to reach a tremendous, global user base for businesses and individuals alike. The great success and opportunities also open up overwhelming challenges due to the drastic growth and increasing complexity of the internet in the last decade. The main challenge for development and operations is to provide reliable and fast service, despite of fast growth in both traffic and frequency of requests. When it comes to speed, internet users have high demands on the performance of online services. Recent research has shown that 47% of online consumers expect load times of two seconds or less. This puts high pressure on web applications and websites in terms of performance and reliability, when even minor changes in performance can have significant effects on how users perceive an application and decide whether or not to continue with their interaction. If the revenue of a business is generated through their online presence, performance directly correlates with loss of sales, and damage of brand perception. With the growth of the internet and its user base, the underlying infrastructure has drastically transformed from single server systems to heterogeneous, distributed systems. Thus, the end performance depends on diverse factors in different levels of server systems, networks and infrastructure, which makes providing a satisfying end-user experience and QoS a challenge for large scale internet applications. In this thesis, statistical methods are applied to deal with the management of web performance issues. In order to properly manage performance, the timely observation and analysis of performance degradation is of key importance. Statistical changepoint analysis and exploratory visual analysis are applied to results obtained through synthetic monitoring of a simulation system to identify and discuss how performance issues in web applications can be detected. Web Performance Benchmarking of competitors is discussed as a way to establish a baseline for an overall performance goal. A general methodology for web performance benchmarking is developed based on statistical analysis of finite collections of observed data from production systems. The presented approach is then applied in a case study for benchmarking search engine providers.","tags":null,"title":"Statistical Methods in Managing Web Performance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Florian Kleedorfer","Christina Maria Busch","Christian Pichler","Christian Huemer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"0e5755bf323273d9e9e55f6dfecf8eed","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-237340/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-237340/","section":"publication","summary":"E-marketplaces on the World Wide Web are information and transaction silos, which in the general case don't allow transactions across their boundaries.

While model checking is successfully applied for hardware verification, it is not widespreadly used in model-driven engineering (MDE). Thus, we tried to reduce this gap by combining modeling and model checking concepts.  This thesis first describes the history and basic idea of both MDE and model checking with a focus on the technologies used in this thesis. Before presenting our new approach, existing solutions are compared. Most approaches propose to extend the Object Constraint Language (OCL) by temporal aspects. This allows to describe the behavior of a software system additionally to various properties of static models. However, one of the main missing features in general seems to be a user-friendly representation of the verification result helpful for debugging. Often, the technical spaces are changed.  With our solution we provide (i) a temporal OCL extension based on the Computational Tree Logic (CTL) and (ii) an OCL extension that introduces path selectors to extract interesting system configurations from the state space. Both OCL extensions were formally defined and implemented. We describe systems in terms of state spaces consisting of EMOF-model states and state transitions containing a mapping between model elements of different states. The system behavior is specified using an initial Ecore model and graph transformations based on the Henshin tool2. The approach, however, is designed to be flexible enough to allow an easy integration of any kind of behavior specification as long as a suitable state space can be derived thereof. Our model checking framework is developed with a focus on delivering not only the results, but also making the system behavior leading to the result comprehensible by providing a suitable tool including a web interface.  The implementation was evaluated in terms of performance to find out the maximum evaluable model size and query complexity. Further, a qualitative user study was conducted for evaluating the CTL extension and the tool. The results of this study indicate that both the CTL-based extension of OCL as well as the tool are a promising first step to integrate model checking in the MDE life cycle.","tags":null,"title":"Towards Software Model Checking in the Context of Model-Driven Engineering","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Danijel Novakovic","Christian Huemer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1387152000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1387152000,"objectID":"8e0c4b8f5a39352f8ea5c84cf9a06d64","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-223224/","publishdate":"2013-12-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-223224/","section":"publication","summary":"Business transactions between companies are more and more executed by a flow of well-defined electronic business documents.

However, these standards typically present the superset of all required elements used in any business context. In a specific context (in a specific industry, in a specific geopolitical region, etc.) the input/output is adjusted to this context by constraints on the generic structure. Accordingly, a specific service is always used in a specific context. It follows that it is important to define the business context of a service (in a structured format).

The solution supports the efficient integration of diverse engineering tools, such as simulators, SCADA systems, or even proprietary software used in particular projects. The proposed approach supports reasoning techniques and efficient utilization of domain specific languages for each engineer or expert. Ontologies comprise explicitly specified knowledge, enable to interchange it between automation tools and can guarantee consistency of the whole integrated solution. The presented approach can be used for both continuous and discrete systems, especially the large-scale ones. A practical example, describing a passive house with ontology individuals and generating a structure of a simulation model automatically by the implemented tool, is involved in this paper.","tags":null,"title":"Ontology-Based Industrial Plant Description Supporting Simulation Model Design and Maintenance","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Danijel Novakovic","Christian Huemer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1382918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1382918400,"objectID":"dd7d320ec4fbf992702bea38ecb0d587","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-220860/","publishdate":"2013-10-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-220860/","section":"publication","summary":"The reliable, efficient and seamless exchange of business information is essential for a successful execution of the interwoven business processes.

In this paper we describe the Unified Context Model (UCM) introduced by the United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT). We explain the shortcomings of the approach and show how these can be undermined by our Enhanced Unified Context Model (E-UCM). The enhanced model serves as a basis for contextualizing business documents which are exchanged between different inter-organizational business processes. Having such an approach at hand, helps prevent negative trends in today's business, such as interoperability issues, inconsistencies and heterogeneous interpretations of the exchanged data contents.","tags":null,"title":"Context Model for Business Context Sensitive Business Documents","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter Ferschin","Monika Di Angelo","Galina Paskaleva"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1382918400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1382918400,"objectID":"141e495bce55b84cfe377365f1e7f687","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-223198/","publishdate":"2013-10-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-223198/","section":"publication","summary":"Traditional Balinese architecture is based on ancient Bali-Hindu philosophy which can be observed in traditional built environments on Bali. The underlying architectural principles are very complex containing intrinsic \"parametric rules\" based on both a philosophical and a building tradition. The parameters are in relation to the religious belief system as well as being derived from the bodily dimensions of the \"head\" of a building. We aim at determining in which way these underlying building principles can be preserved by contemporary digital means. As a hypothesis we test a parametric formalization as CGA shape grammar made operative using the CityEngine. In order to formalize these building principles the following methods were devised: identification and collection of appropriate literature in English and Indonesian, partial translation of available material to English, field trips for contextual information and additional knowledge, and transformation of all sources of information into a shape grammar. An interactive visualization of ancient Balinese building principles is exemplified through the traditional house compound, the \"rumah\", demonstrating the strength of a parametric approach. Moreover, it includes both, tangible and intangible heritage aspects by analyzing the appearance of (tangible) built heritage, as well as the (intangible) underlying philosophy and traditional knowledge. Our contribution aims at supporting the understanding and preservation of the architectural heritage of Balinese building principles.","tags":null,"title":"Parametric Balinese Rumah - Procedural Modeling of Traditional Balinese Architecture","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Bart Meyers","Manuel Wimmer","Hans Vangheluwe","Joachim Denil"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1382832000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1382832000,"objectID":"d958a8b4f2a0c2bcf73d7b31c3d1f300","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-220936/","publishdate":"2013-10-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-220936/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Towards Domain-Specific Property Languages: The ProMoBox Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tanja Mayerhofer","Philip Langer","Manuel Wimmer","Gertrude Kappel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1382832000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1382832000,"objectID":"bbae4cb7b7f59768cbabdf768f273584","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-220879/","publishdate":"2013-10-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-220879/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"xMOF: Executable DSMLs based on fUML","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Loli Burgueño","Manuel Wimmer","Javier Troya","Antonio Vallecillo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1380672000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1380672000,"objectID":"d05d267c0c1474753f63e6fded9b4b1a","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-222167/","publishdate":"2013-10-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-222167/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"TractsTool: Testing MTs based on Contracts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tanja Mayerhofer","Philip Langer","Manuel Wimmer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1380672000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1380672000,"objectID":"759c010fcf7c698d9a051af97b1e4513","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-223432/","publishdate":"2013-10-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-223432/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"xMOF: A Semantics Specification Language for Metamodeling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jürgen Etzlstorfer","Angelika Kusel","Elisabeth Kapsammer","Philip Langer","Werner Retschitzegger","Johannes Schönböck","Wieland Schwinger","Manuel Wimmer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1380499200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1380499200,"objectID":"b3f8c0a7ea744cc882a1c143e1b116d9","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-220870/","publishdate":"2013-09-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-220870/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A Survey on Incremental Model Transformation Approaches","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marion Scholz","Petra Kaufmann","Martina Seidl"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1380499200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1380499200,"objectID":"dec63af5705044de0cee962d60bb14ba","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-223488/","publishdate":"2013-09-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-223488/","section":"publication","summary":"We steadily aim at improving our first year´s university course Introduction to Object-Oriented Modelling.

These requirements are widespread for example in the area of virtual power plants. The proposed architecture addresses a SCADA level of the automation pyramid. The results are demonstrated on a use-case dealing with a set of distributed combined heat and power units, which should be integrated into a single virtual power plant.

This is due to the fact that a standardized document type represents a superset of all data elements required in any industry, in any geopolitical region, etc. Furthermore, standardized document types are defined as stand-alone documents, similar to paper-based documents, comprising all information from previous process steps. In other words, standardization neglects the notion of processes by repeating information in different documents of the same process. In this paper, we propose a methodology for assessing redundancies in business document exchanges and evaluate different real-world industry message implementation guidelines (MIGs) with respect to their efficiency in reducing complexity and redundancies. Insights on redundancies can help companies and standardization committees to improve designs of MIGs and entire EDI standards. Furthermore, one can use the concepts presented in this paper to compare different MIGs with regard to their (dis)similarities, which might be useful when two organizations are to be merged and their IT systems consolidated.","tags":null,"title":"Inter-organizational Business Processes: On Redundancies in Document Exchanges","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Danijel Novakovic","Christian Huemer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1375056000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1375056000,"objectID":"e52ef183ad959005c74edd2cf34e27a8","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-220689/","publishdate":"2013-07-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-220689/","section":"publication","summary":"Business document standards usually cover a hierarchical structure of thousands of elements that may be relevant in any business context (any industry, any geopolitical region, etc.).

This broad adoption has not only been fostered by a rich and wellestablished theory to model, analyze, simulate, and enact business processes, but also by internationally accepted standards and mature technologies. Caused by the ever increasing speed and volatility of markets and the dynamics of new technologies, such as cloud infrastructures and mobile communications, we face a new generation of business processes, which we refer to as living inter-organizational processes. Such processes are not in control of one single organization; instead, they are enacted by multiple organizations, where no participating party possesses full control over the entire process. Such processes often involve a high number of actors that might even be unknown in advance. These actors require various degrees in participation, they are acting in heterogeneous environments. Moreover, such processes are often weakly structured or designed in an ad-hoc manner, and have to be continuously subject to evolution. Unfortunately, existing theories, methodologies, and technologies cannot cope with this challenging combination of aspects, which all have to be considered when dealing with living inter-organizational processes. The state of the art typically addresses singular aspects in isolation. However, a holistic approach to these challenges bears a tremendous potential. This paper aims to contribute towards a holistic approach to living inter-organizational processes. To this end, we describe different perspectives on inter-organizational processes and identify challenges for making them living processes.","tags":null,"title":"Towards Living Inter-Organizational Processes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Markus Gruber","Christian Schanes","Florian Fankhauser","Thomas Grechenig"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1373414400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1373414400,"objectID":"a8311758a1a58576bb7206a5776a77b9","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-226076/","publishdate":"2013-07-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-226076/","section":"publication","summary":"The number of Voice over IP systems and the number of Session Initiation Protocol users is constantly increasing.

If we could assign a Business Context to a business process, we could undermine negative trends in today's business, such as interoperability issues, inconsistencies and heterogeneous interpretations of different business processes.","tags":null,"title":"A Survey on Business Context","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Markus Gruber","Christian Schanes","Florian Fankhauser","Martin Moutran","Thomas Grechenig"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1370217600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1370217600,"objectID":"2baacdbe48f525fbc00a38ba09207f46","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-226061/","publishdate":"2013-06-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-226061/","section":"publication","summary":"Voice over IP systems are more and more replacing Public Switched Telephone Network infrastructures.

A major problem is to read and understand source-code that was produced by someone else. With different programming styles and complex interactions, understanding the code under review is the most expensive sub-task of a code review. As with many other modern software engineering practices, code reviews may be applied as a continuous process to reduce the effort and support the concept of collective ownership. This study evaluates the effect of a continuous code review process on the understandability and collective ownership of the code base. A group of 8 subjects performed a total of 114 code reviews within 18 months in an industrial context and conducted an expert evaluation according to this research question. This study concludes that there is a clear positive effect on the understandability and collective ownership of the code base with continuous code reviews, but also limiting factors and drawbacks for complex review tasks.","tags":null,"title":"On the understanding of programs with continuous code reviews","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marouane Kessentini","Philip Langer","Manuel Wimmer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1369008000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1369008000,"objectID":"668c3be259b09c68c37603412e1bb00f","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-217900/","publishdate":"2013-05-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-217900/","section":"publication","summary":"In the past years, several researchers applied search-based optimization algorithms successfully in the software engineering domain to obtain automatically near-optimal solutions to complex problems posing huge solution spaces.

After a stroke, patients often complain about balance related problems or partial paralysis. Normal rehabilitation training depends on balance and strength exercises. In such cases balance plates are often used as training devices, but patients often report lack of motivation especially when training at home. The research objective of this publication was to develop a serious game using the Nintendo Wii Fit Balance Board. From a physiotherapeutic view it should help patients suffering from a stroke throughout their rehabilitation, especially to increase the motivation to do their exercises. Since every patient is different, the developed serious game can be customized by a physiotherapist for the individual patient's needs. A lot of customization options provide optimal support for the entire rehabilitation process.","tags":null,"title":"Chances for Serious Games in Rehabilitation of Stroke Patients on the Example of Utilizing the Wii Fit Balance Board","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Danijel Novakovic","Christian Huemer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1366243200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1366243200,"objectID":"0f51e6ed0a43378e13a8a0ee65d04030","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-220684/","publishdate":"2013-04-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-220684/","section":"publication","summary":"One and the same inter-organizational business process - such as e-procurement - may be executed differently in different industries, geopolitical regions, etc. Thus, a standardized reference model for inter-organizational business process must be customized to the specific business context (industry, region, etc.).

Thus, in addition to technical aspects, business aspects need also to be considered. ARTIST proposes a comprehensive software modernization approach covering business and technical aspects. In particular, ARTIST employs Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) techniques to automate the reverse engineering of legacy software and forward engineering of cloud-based software in a way that modernized software truly benefits from targeted cloud environments.

The operations applied between two successive versions of a model are crucial for understanding its evolution. Generic approaches for detecting operations a posteriori identify atomic operations, but neglect composite operations, such as refactorings, which leads to cluttered difference reports.  To tackle this limitation, we present an orthogonal extension of existing atomic operation detection approaches for detecting also composite operations. Our approach searches for occurrences of composite operations within a set of detected atomic operations in a post-processing manner. One major benefit is the reuse of specifications available for executing composite operations also for detecting applications of them. We evaluate the accuracy of the approach in a real-world case study and investigate the scalability of our implementation in an experiment.","tags":null,"title":"A Posteriori Operation Detection in Evolving Software Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christian Huemer","Philipp Liegl","Marco Zapletal"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"0292466bad25f40b99abbcf8c94cf16f","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-216959/","publishdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-216959/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Eine Plattform für den elektronischen Austausch von Geschäftsdokumenten","type":"publication"},{"authors":["René Baranyi","Nadja Lederer","Rainer Willinger","Dennis Matthias Binder","Thomas Grechenig"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"6c4f0a02c629541ddcaf24f116a5465d","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-226054/","publishdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-226054/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Einsatzmöglichkeiten von technischen Devices aus der Spieleindustrie zur Unterstützung von SchlaganfallpatientInnen","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christian Pichler","Christian Huemer","Manuel Wimmer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"a46a747d2f0320992d646edc557c7bae","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-219163/","publishdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-219163/","section":"publication","summary":"Standardized business documents are a prerequisite for successful information exchange in electronic business transactions. The United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and eBusiness (UN/CEFACT) provides a conceptual modeling approach, called Core Components, used by Business Partners (BPs) for defining business document models (BDMs). BDMs are essential for defining service interfaces in service-oriented systems. However, in such a highly dynamic environment with ever-changing market demands, BPs are confronted with the need to revise their BDMs resulting in a multitude of different versions. BPs may dictate the use of new versions of BDMs, but small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) may not always adopt new BDM versions due to the cost and effort involved, inhibiting automated electronic information exchange. In this article, we propose a framework including (i) a classification of the impact of changes in BDMs, (ii) evolution templates for the automated transformation of business documents between different BDM versions, and (iii) mitigation strategies for evolutions where fully-automated and semantic-preserving transformations are not feasible. Having such a framework at hand provides SMEs with a low-cost and light-weight approach for dealing with evolving market requirements and hence evolving business documents. Finally, we analyze the evolution of UN/CEFACT's Cross Industry Invoice which has been mandated to be used for electronic invoicing within the European Union as well as present a critical discussion of the evolution templates defined.","tags":null,"title":"Evolution of Business Documents Based on UN/CEFACT's Core Components","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Petr Novak","Martin Melik-Merkumians","Michael Steinegger","Thomas Moser","Radek Sindelar","Alois Zoitl"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"c9c0eee4e6b84eabf6655282dece526f","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-222305/","publishdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-222305/","section":"publication","summary":"Design and integration of industrial automation systems require cooperation of different engineering disciplines and various engineering tools during both design-time and runtime. The scope of this chapter is to bridge the gap between the design-time description and the runtime integration in a semiautomated way. Furthermore, this chapter focuses on the problem of the integration of legacy systems with limited access to original engineering data. It is assumed that an interface between a real industrial system and software automation tools is OPC Unified Architecture (OPC UA) and we propose to derive the plant knowledge from the OPC UA tag list. Since it is not possible to solve this task in general, we require the tag list to adopt the naming convention defined by the international standard IEC 81346, which is widespread in large-scale systems. This tag list is parsed and the engineering knowledge is derived and stored in the Engineering Knowledge Base. Consequently, the plant knowledge is mapped to knowledge related to software automation tools, such as simulations. The proposed methodology is evaluated on a real-life example dealing with a laboratory tank model.","tags":null,"title":"Extraction of Automation System Engineering Knowledge for Mapping Plant and Simulation Interfaces","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jan Liu","Steffen Zschaler","Benoit Baudry","Sudipto Ghosh","Davide Di Ruscio","Ethan Jackson","Manuel Wimmer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"e3c7e5176d2c0576ada1d8175a4a08b3","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-236403/","publishdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-236403/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Joint Proceedings of MODELS'13 Invited Talks, Demonstration Session, Poster Session, and ACM Student Research Competition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Angelika Kusel","Johannes Schönböck","Manuel Wimmer","Gertrude Kappel","Werner Retschitzegger","Wieland Schwinger"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"897e49c4e5cd996f5e78bf9f5da89da0","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-218002/","publishdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-218002/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Reuse in Model-to-Model Transformation Languages: Are we there yet?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Konrad Wieland","Philip Langer","Martina Seidl","Manuel Wimmer","Gertrude Kappel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1356998400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1356998400,"objectID":"936e87d34daac9c6e518a30cb4f38066","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-209353/","publishdate":"2013-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-209353/","section":"publication","summary":"In model-driven software development, software models are the main artifacts used not only for supporting brainstorming, analysis, and design purposes, but also for generating executable code. Such software models are usually not created by one single developer, but within a team. To coordinate team work, versioning systems have proven to be indispensable for managing modifications performed by different modelers at the same time. When concurrently performed modifications are contradicting each other, the standard versioning paradigm requires the person who detected the conflict to resolve it immediately in order to keep the evolved artifacts in a consistent state. Whereas this approach works well in later phases of the software development process, in early phases, when the development team had not established a consolidated view on the system under development yet, the conflicts might provide valuable information on the various intentions of the modelers. This information might be lost if removed in an undocumented manner by a single modeler. We propose an alternative versioning paradigm for models, where conflicts are temporarily tolerated and discuss its technical realization for current modeling languages such as the UML. The resolution of conflicts is then not performed by one single modeler but within a team so that a consolidated version of the model is obtained.","tags":null,"title":"Turning Conflicts into Collaboration - Concurrent Modeling in the Early Phases of Software Development","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Johannes Schönböck","Gertrude Kappel","Manuel Wimmer","Angelika Kusel","Werner Retschitzegger","Wieland Schwinger"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1354579200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1354579200,"objectID":"839eb6406939da540832e74ec377b962","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-211303/","publishdate":"2012-12-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-211303/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Debugging Model-to-Model Transformations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thomas Grechenig","Paul Pöltner","Isabella Wagner","Emilio Mosse","Andrey Shindyapin"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1354060800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1354060800,"objectID":"4e09c65d77ab6cf4d5ec9a03b4adcc5a","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-216563/","publishdate":"2012-11-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-216563/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"ICT4DMZ Strengthening universities' capacities for improved access, use and application of ICT for social development and economic growth in Mozambique","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thomas Grechenig","Thomas Spitta","Monika Suppersberger","Roland Steininger","Christof Kier","Martina Pöll"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1352851200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1352851200,"objectID":"5d9914268b9746c0921bda145699c96c","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-215523/","publishdate":"2012-11-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-215523/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Entwicklung und Betrieb eines Campus-Management-Systems - Aspekte zur Nachhaltigkeit am Beispiel Tiss","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tanja Mayerhofer","Philip Langer","Manuel Wimmer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1350864000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1350864000,"objectID":"38796efef4d61c991757c6c6b8d723f2","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-210096/","publishdate":"2012-10-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-210096/","section":"publication","summary":"When defining a domain-specific modeling language (DSML), the two key components that have to be specified are its syntax and semantics. For specifying a modeling language´s abstract syntax, metamodels are the standard means. MOF provides a standardized, well established, and widely accepted metamodeling language enabling the definition of metamodels and the generation of accompanying modeling facilities. However, no such standard means exist for specifying the behavioral semantics of a DSML. This hampers the efficient development of model execution facilities, such as debugging, simulation, and verification. To overcome this limitation, we propose to integrate fUML with MOF to enable the specification of the behavioral semantics for DSMLs in terms of fUML activities. We discuss alternatives how this integration can be achieved and show by-example how to specify the semantics of a DSML using fUML. To reuse existing runtime infrastructures, we further demonstrate the usage of external libraries in fUML-based specifications.","tags":null,"title":"Towards xMOF: Executable DSMLs based on fUML","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrew Vande Moere","Martin Tomitsch","Christoph Wimmer","Christoph Bösch","Thomas Grechenig"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1350172800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1350172800,"objectID":"fb586bb160b4aefc7c04c576f88df95e","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-215556/","publishdate":"2012-10-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-215556/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper reports on a between-subject, comparative online study of three information visualization demonstrators that each displayed the same dataset by way of an identical scatterplot technique, yet were different in style in terms of visual and interactive embellishment.

However, in spite of significant differences in apparent usability, enjoyability and usefulness between the style demonstrators, no variation was found on the self-reported depth, expert-rated depth, confidence or difficulty of the resulting insights. Three different methods of insight analysis have been applied, revealing how style impacts the creation of insights, ranging from higher-level pattern seeking to a more reflective and interpretative engagement with content, which is what underlies the patterns.

It is commonly accepted that code reviews are an effective quality assurance technique even if a rigorous application is also a high cost factor. For large software systems a formal method may be inapplicable throughout the whole codebase. In this study an airport operational database (AODB) is developed with the application of a more lightweight approach to code reviews. A continuous, distributed and change-based process is applied by the development team and evaluated in comparison to team walkthroughs (IEEE-1028) as a baseline method. The application showed to be highly useful, equally effective as the baseline, but more efficient especially for the preparation, execution and rework effort. The results show that continuous code reviews also support the understanding of the codebase and the concept of collective ownership. Such processes may not completely substitute a more formal and effortful technique. Especially for reviewing critical design aspects or complex items a traditional approach is still more appropriate. The main outcome is that such lightweight code reviews may be used together with more formal approaches to ensure a high coverage and that the degree of formalism should be adopted to the criticality of the item under review.","tags":null,"title":"Applying Continuous Code Reviews in Airport Operations Software","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Radek Sindelar","Petr Novak"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1343174400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1343174400,"objectID":"0e1488b18307cdbd6a518eaea8408b22","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-215462/","publishdate":"2012-07-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-215462/","section":"publication","summary":"Integration of simulators, data sources, optimizers and other tools is discussed in this paper.

Finding an appropriate business partner requires to know his business capabilities or in other words which products or services he offers. For this purpose, we develop a seamless integration of the product portfolios, held in the ERP systems, into the ERPEL registry. A search in the registry has to disclose the technical capabilities of a potential business partner to ensure interoperability. Overloaded business document standards and a variety of different communication protocols hamper an effective communication between enterprises. Thus, ERPEL follows a bottom-up approach starting from core documents with well-defined extension mechanisms.

The major concern was to design and implement a legal and technical system within the conditions given by the Directive, but guaranteeing a maximum protection of the Austrian citizens´ personal data and privacy. Therefore it allows a centrally managed access in conformity with the law to necessary retention data for corresponding responsible authorities. One of the core aspects to ensure citizens privacy is the fact that all retention data may only be stored by the respective telecommunication providers and authorities have to request required data only in entitled cases. Access to retention data has to comply to regulations of the four-eye principle and conforming logging has to be carried out, as well as further authorities must be notified about such a data request. Any communication between the enumerated actors has to be performed via a specifically constructed communication system, called DLS. The DLS is implemented in a way to ensure confidentiality, authenticity, integrity and non-repudiation for all requests and responses as well as to carry out legally required notifications. Therefore, this system on the one hand implements high confidential encryption and authentication techniques and on the other hand automatically performs all the required notifications and logging, all without being able to have insight to the transmitted sensitive data. The article gives a comprehensive overview about the whole system designed to implement the Data Retention Directive regarding both the legal environment and the corresponding technical implementation. Moreover should be shown how this system is able to ensure that data accesses to retention data only happen in conformity with the law and breaches of citizens´ privacy could be prevented.","tags":null,"title":"The Austrian Approach Concerning the European Data Retention Directive´s Translation into National Law and its Technical Implementation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Petra Kaufmann","Uwe Egly","Sebastian Gabmeyer","Gertrude Kappel","Martina Seidl","Hans Tompits","Magdalena Widl","Manuel Wimmer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1338422400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1338422400,"objectID":"61ebb670b43593e521f1ce973d00adbc","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-208181/","publishdate":"2012-05-31T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-208181/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Towards Scenario-Based Testing of UML Diagrams","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Manuel Wimmer","Nathalie Moreno","Antonio Vallecillo"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1338249600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1338249600,"objectID":"6e3b44eaead00edc44d63259d4070ad2","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-208187/","publishdate":"2012-05-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-208187/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Viewpoint Co-evolution through Coarse-Grained Changes and Coupled Transformations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Manuel Wimmer","Gertrude Kappel","Angelika Kusel","Werner Retschitzegger","Johannes Schönböck","Wieland Schwinger"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1338163200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1338163200,"objectID":"d51f7290b1ca31c6f28b01682af2368c","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-208182/","publishdate":"2012-05-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-208182/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Fact or Fiction - Reuse in Rule-Based Model-to-Model Transformation Languages","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Petr Novak","Martin Melik-Merkumians","Michael Steinegger","Thomas Moser","Radek Sindelar","Alois Zoitl"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1337731200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1337731200,"objectID":"c996f7d421d01b85c49836b26622f399","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-209063/","publishdate":"2012-05-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-209063/","section":"publication","summary":"Design and integration of industrial automation systems require cooperation of different engineering disciplines and various engineering tools during both design and run time. The scope of this paper is to bridge the gap between design-time description and runtime integration in a semi-automated way. Furthermore, we address the problem of integrating legacy systems with no access to original engineering data. It is assumed that an interface between a real industrial system and software automation tools is OPC Unified Architecture (UA) and we propose to derive the plant knowledge from the OPC UA tag list. Since it is not possible to solve this task in general, we require the tag list to adopt the naming convention of IEC 81346, which is widespread in large-scale systems. This tag list is parsed and the engineering knowledge is derived and stored in the Engineering Knowledge Base. Consequently, the plant knowledge is mapped to knowledge related to software automation tools, such as simulators. The proposed methodology is evaluated on a real-life example dealing with a laboratory tank model.","tags":null,"title":"Semantic Runtime Interface Description Based on Engineering Knowledge","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Monika Di Angelo","Peter Ferschin","Galina Paskaleva"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1334793600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1334793600,"objectID":"e5e9f1f3a543eb2d745fb04fb5370ac5","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-207796/","publishdate":"2012-04-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-207796/","section":"publication","summary":"Shape grammars have been introduced in architectural theory some decades ago. They have been applied to architectural construction methods (e.g. Chinese traditional wooden buildings) or for analyzing the design patterns of well-known architects (e.g. Palladio, Frank Lloyd-Wright). These examples demonstrated that complex geometrical shapes could be generated by a set of replacement rules out of a start symbol, usually a simple geometric shape. With the advent of powerful tools like the CityEngine an interesting field for practical applications of these grammars arose opening a whole range of new possibilities for architectural heritage. On the one hand, a description of ancient building principles in the formalized way of a shape grammar can aid the understanding and preservation of cultural heritage. With the possibility to actually construct digital 3D models out of shape grammars, they became even more interesting. Furthermore, this approach allows for a large scale creation of 3D models of entire settlements and cities. On the other hand, shape grammars allow for structured approaches to virtual 3D reconstruction as has been demonstrated for e.g. Mayan or Roman architecture. Besides that, the possibility to specify parameterized variations of the models proves to be an extremely helpful feature. In this paper we reconsider shape grammars in architecture and examine influences onto procedural modelling. Then we argue for state-of-the-art tools like the CityEngine that apply shape grammars and procedural modelling in architectural contexts and exemplify their power and potential by reconstructing traditional Balinese settlements.","tags":null,"title":"Shape Grammars for Architectural Heritage","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Martin Wischenbart","Stefan Mitsch","Elisabeth Kapsammer","Angelika Kusel","Birgit Pröll","Werner Retschitzegger","Wieland Schwinger","Johannes Schönböck","Manuel Wimmer","Stephan Lechner"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1334534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1334534400,"objectID":"c6e16f4c59fcd5c5eb44a790b050dfed","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-209282/","publishdate":"2012-04-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-209282/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"User Profile Integration Made Easy - Model-Driven Extraction and Transformation of Social Network Schemas","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andreas Mauczka","Markus Huber","Christian Schanes","Wolfgang Schramm","Mario Bernhart","Thomas Grechenig"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1332547200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1332547200,"objectID":"e986c9e8d9b8403428cf301ce3926d07","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-215174/","publishdate":"2012-03-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-215174/","section":"publication","summary":"A commit message is a description of a change in a Version Control System (VCS).

REA is a widely accepted framework for the design of a conceptual model of the accountability infrastructure of enterprise information systems. Originally, REA targeted the resource flows within and between companies describing what is currently occurring and what has occurred in the past. This is known as the operational layer. Later it was extended by a planning layer and a policy layer capturing what should, could, or must be occurring sometime in the future. Today, REA may be considered as a powerful business ontology capturing all relevant data to generate the conceptual design of an Accounting Information System (AIS). However, we feel that it does not deliver an appropriate representation of the business model which can be understood not only by the IT expert, but also by the business expert. Thus, the use of REA in the design of AIS does not yet reach its full potential. We argue, that an easy-to-understand REA notation will accelerate, streamline, and reduce the costs of the AIS development process.  Consequently, we have developed a domain specific modeling language for the REA concepts called the REA-DSL which aims at both (i) delivering an intuitive REA notation and (ii) retaining the full expressiveness of the REA concepts. The step we are conducting right now and covering in this paper is the incorporation of properties and primary keys into our REA-DSL and the final automatic generation of an Entity-Relationship-Diagram (ERD) for an AIS from the REA-DSL using our tool.","tags":null,"title":"Business-Model-Driven Data Engineering Using the REA-DSL","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christian Pichler","Robert Engel","Christian Huemer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1327449600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1327449600,"objectID":"e3174fba75b14b91e2ecaa116d7811ca","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-201826/","publishdate":"2012-01-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-201826/","section":"publication","summary":"The United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and eBusiness (UN/CEFACT) provides the Core Components approach for defining standard business document types based on all-embracing, reusable building blocks.

Therefore, versioning of models is a key technique to be offered by integrated development environments for model-driven engineering. In contrast to text-based versioning systems, we present an approach that takes model structures and their changes over time into account. Considering model structures as graphs, we define a fundamental approach where model revisions are considered as graph modifications consisting of delete and insert actions. Two different kinds of conflict detection are presented: (1) the check for operation-based conflicts between different graph modifications, and (2) the check for state-based conflicts on merged graph modifications. For the merging of graph modifications, a two-phase approach is proposed: First, operational conflicts are temporarily resolved by always giving insertion priority over deletion to keep as much information as possible. Thereafter, this tentative merge result is the basis for manual conflict resolution as well as for the application of repair actions that resolve state-based conflicts. If preferred by the user, giving deletion priority over insertion might be one solution. The fundamental concepts are illustrated by versioning scenarios for simplified statecharts. Furthermore, we show an implementation of this fundamental approach to model versioning based on the Eclipse Modeling Framework as technical space.","tags":null,"title":"A fundamental approach to model versioning based on graph modifications: from theory to implementation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Esther Guerra","Juan De Lara","Manuel Wimmer","Gertrude Kappel","Angelika Kusel","Werner Retschitzegger","Johannes Schönböck","Wieland Schwinger"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"06e629cf9a3704c2f36c80fce5d4395e","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-207083/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-207083/","section":"publication","summary":"Model-Driven Engineering promotes the use of models to conduct the different phases of the software development. In this way, models are transformed between different languages and notations until code is generated for the final application. Hence, the construction of correct Model-to-Model (M2M) transformations becomes a crucial aspect in this approach. Even though many languages and tools have been proposed to build and execute M2M transformations, there is scarce support to specify correctness requirements for such transformations in an implementation-independent way, i.e., irrespective of the actual transformation language used.  In this paper we fill this gap by proposing a declarative language for the specification of visual contracts, enabling the verification of transformations defined with any transformation language. The verification is performed by compiling the contracts into QVT to detect disconformities of transformation results with respect to the contracts. As a proof of concept, we also report on a graphical modeling environment for the specification of contracts, and on its use for the verification of transformations in several case studies.","tags":null,"title":"Automated verification of model transformations based on visual contracts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Petra Kaufmann","Martina Seidl","Manuel Wimmer","Gertrude Kappel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"b296f40fa52205da7243e2a9dc3767e8","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-210103/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-210103/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Conflict Visualization for Evolving UML Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Grossniklaus","Manuel Wimmer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"fdcfa4e3944a430778999c68a1c84d53","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-211713/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-211713/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Current Trends in Web Engineering - ICWE 2012 International Workshops: MDWE, ComposableWeb, WeRE, QWE, and Doctoral Consortium, Revised Selected Papers","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christian Huemer","Pasquale Lops"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1325376000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1325376000,"objectID":"8972c6c9975ed16fdf8906165be2935d","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-216012/","publishdate":"2012-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-216012/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"E-Commerce and Web Technologies - 13th International Conference, EC-Web 2012, Vienna, Austria, September 4-5, 2012.

As any other software artifact, DSMLs should continuously evolve to adapt to the changing needs of the domain they represent. Unfortunately, right now evolution of DSMLs is a costly process that requires changing the DSML metamodel and re-creating the complete modeling environment. In this paper we advocate for the use of EMF Profiles, an adaptation of the UML Profile concept to DSMLs. Profiles have been a key enabler for the success of UML by providing a lightweight language-inherent extension mechanism which is expressive enough to cover an important subset of extension scenarios. We believe a similar concept for DSMLs would provide a valuable extension mechanism which has been so far neglected by current metamodeling tools. Apart from direct metamodel profiles, we also propose reusable profile definition mechanisms whereby profiles are defined independently of any DSML and, later on, coupled with all DSMLs that can benefit from these profiles. Our approach has been implemented in a prototype integrated in the EMF environment.","tags":null,"title":"EMF Profiles: A Lightweight Extension Approach for EMF Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Louis M.

In this context, model transformations are crucial for the success of MDE, being comparable in role and importance to compilers for high-level programming languages. Thus, several model transformation approaches have been developed in the last decade, whereby originally most of them are based on the abstract syntax of modeling languages. However, this implementation specific focus makes it difficult for modelers to develop model transformations, because they are familiar with the concrete syntax but not with its computer internal representation.  To tackle this problem, model transformation by-example approaches have been proposed which follow the same fundamental idea as query by-example and programming by-example approaches. Instead of using the computer internal representation of models, examples represented in concrete syntax are used to define transformations. Because different transformation scenarios occur in MDE, different by-example approaches have been developed.

The United Nations Centre for Trade Facilitation and eBusiness (UN/CEFACT) provides a conceptual modeling approach, called Core Components, used by Business Partners (BPs) for defining business document models (BDMs). These BDMs are essential for defining service interfaces in service-oriented systems. However, in such a highly dynamic environment with ever-changing market demands, BPs are confronted with the need to revise their BDMs resulting in new versions of BDMs. Furthermore, BPs may dictate the use of new versions of BDMs. However, small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) may not always adopt new BDM versions due to the cost and effort involved, inhibiting electronic information exchange. In this paper, we present a framework for dealing with interoperability issues in service-oriented systems through providing BPs with Business Document Interoperability as a Service. Having such a framework at hand provides SMEs with a low-cost and light-weight approach for dealing with evolving market requirements and hence evolving business documents.

Despite the wide range of possible usage, their formalization, integration and design have not been satisfactorily solved. This paper contributes to the design phase of simulation models for large-scale industrial systems, consisting of a large number of heterogeneous components. Nowadays, it is the simulation expert who assembles the simulation model for a particular industrial plant manually, which is time-consuming and error-prone. We propose to use a semantic engine performing SPARQL queries, which assembles the structure of a simulation model semi-automatically, using formalized knowledge about real industrial plant and available simulation blocks represented in appropriate ontologies. As each real plant device can be represented by more than one simulation blocks, the selection of suitable simulation candidates is based on matching interfaces of neighboring blocks. Evaluation on a real-life industrial use-case shows improvements in reducing development time and avoiding design errors. Major results of this paper are the proposed structures of the ontologies and the SPARQL query realizing the selection of the appropriate simulation blocks.","tags":null,"title":"Applications of Ontologies for Assembling Simulation Models of Industrial Systems","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Harald Köstinger","Thomas Grechenig","Klaus Bayrhammer","Michael Fiedler","Wolfgang Schramm"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1318723200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1318723200,"objectID":"45e02b14d4cdbf186e6981b3c9df542b","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-205707/","publishdate":"2011-10-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-205707/","section":"publication","summary":"Integrating patient synchronized applications (PSA) into hos-  pital information systems (HIS) is becoming an essential ob-  jective for improving high quality care by reducing the work  created by the recurring task of patient selection within vari-  ous clinical and administrative applications.

Usually, a standard business document type is defined in an all-embracing manner covering all elements needed in any business context, such as geopolitical context, industry context, and others. Before exchanging business documents in a particular business context, business partners have to agree on an implementation guide resulting in a subset of the standard document type. Different subsets of a standard document type may also be considered as variants of the standard document type. Since no agreed methodology for building variants of standard documents types exists, the domain of EDI may learn from Software Engineering. In fact, we are facing the need for managing variants which is typically addressed in Software Configuration Management. In this position paper, we propose utilizing concepts from Product Line Engineering (PLE) for managing variability in business document models.

Simulations are useful tools for process optimization or performance testing and the presented methodology makes their design for particular industrial plants flexible. The use-case shows that the design of simulation models for passive houses can be user-friendly and feasible even for non-experts as it is based on a graphical tool that enables to draw a passive house floor plan. Since neither this tool nor a universal simulation library, comprising atomic simulation blocks, were not intended for simulation purposes, the presented methodology is a typical example of tool integration having heterogeneous data models. The goal of this paper is to propose an ontology-based formalization of knowledge representing structures of real industrial plants and simulation models. The paper also introduces the design of simulation models for passive houses from other engineering sources, which can be used by non-experts for simulation modeling. The practical usage is restricted by the fact that simulation parameters must be entered manually.

In this position paper, we present (i) a reference model supporting hierarchical, collaborative and cross-organizational business document modeling, (ii) a conflict resolution model to find a consolidated version of a new business document model as well as (iii) our vision of a Configurable Collaboration-Aware Online Model Repository.","tags":null,"title":"Towards Collaborative Cross-Organizational Modeling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Radek Sindelar","Petr Novak"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1314489600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1314489600,"objectID":"dafba3a6e928603d2b30caf49e68e86a","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-202267/","publishdate":"2011-08-28T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-202267/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents an idea of integration of simulations into the control system architecture.

However, due to the highly dynamic environment of electronic commerce with ever-changing market requirements, business document models evolve over time. This adds another dimension of variability to the problem domain leading to complex evolution scenarios.

Such tools mean that coordination and administrative procedures do not only have to occur via e-mail or similar technologies. To execute the next administrational step using traditional methods, each officer has to know the inner organisational workflow and therefore those clerks responsible for performing the next administrational step to be able to forward the record to the correct person. Though till now this way of working has been quite common in many official organisations, there are a considerable number of software products available, which implement ERS, to assist performing administrative procedures  electronically. When an officer has finished his respective process step, such a system automatically forwards the documents to the next responsible person. Moreover if several clerks have to perform a step in parallel, it is not necessary to copy the whole file several times but only to grant appropriate access permissions to the documents. Thus at any moment, everyone has the record in its latest version. Furthermore the whole administrative act can be tracked and monitored. It is important to remember however that within the European Union a couple of regulatory rules have to be obeyed when implementing and using such ERS. The providers of such systems as well as the authority using them are responsible for ensuring legal conformity. The aim of this paper is to give a brief overview of the applicable European regulations concerning ERS for responsible stakeholders, such as IT-system designers and providers, administration chiefs, or researchers in the field of e-government.","tags":null,"title":"An Outline of the Technical Requirements on Governmental Electronic Record Systems Derived from the European Legal Environment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Elisabeth Kapsammer","Stefan Mitsch","Birgit Pröll","Werner Retschitzegger","Wieland Schwinger","Manuel Wimmer","Martin Wischenbart"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1306713600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1306713600,"objectID":"ae0eb6a4233871925caf20174f38bb42","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-197429/","publishdate":"2011-05-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-197429/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A First Step Towards a Conceptual Reference Model for Comparing Social User Profiles","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andreas Ehringfeld","Larissa Naber","Karin Kappel","Gerald Fischer","Thomas Grechenig"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1302825600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1302825600,"objectID":"d8d2a7f6bf5b2723d7962791ec913886","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-205869/","publishdate":"2011-04-15T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-205869/","section":"publication","summary":"Despite all progress on the scientific foundations of  information system security, human factor attacks are still not  sufficiently researched.

Since this time the REA model has been further extended and evolved into a domain ontology.

Since feedback proved to be an effective method to promote sustainable behavior a prototype was built that delivers feedback on the water consumption during a shower. The feedback is provided by an ambient display. The shower water meter (show-me) displays the increasing amount of water that is used during one shower in form of LEDs assembled on a stick.

While aspect-orientation originally has emerged at the programming level, it now stretches also over other development phases. There are, for example, already several proposals for Aspect-Oriented Modeling (AOM), most of them pursuing distinguished goals, providing different concepts as well as notations, and showing various levels of maturity. Consequently, there is an urgent need to provide an in-depth survey, clearly identifying commonalities and differences between current AOM approaches. Existing surveys in this area focus more on comprehensibility with respect to development phases or evaluated approaches rather than on comparability on bases of a detailed evaluation framework.  This article tries to fill this gap focusing on aspect-oriented design modeling. As a prerequisite for an in-depth evaluation, a conceptual reference model is presented as the article's first contribution, centrally capturing the basic design concepts of AOM and their interrelationships in terms of a UML class diagram. Based on this conceptual reference model, an evaluation framework has been designed, resembling the second contribution, by deriving a detailed and well-defined catalogue of evaluation criteria, thereby operationalizing the conceptual reference model. This criteria catalogue is employed together with a running example in order to evaluate a carefully selected set of eight design-level AOM approaches representing the third contribution of the article. This per approach evaluation is complemented with an extensive report on lessons learned, summarizing the approaches' strengths and shortcomings.","tags":null,"title":"A survey on UML-based aspect-oriented design modeling","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yu Sun","Jeff Gray","Philip Langer","Gertrude Kappel","Manuel Wimmer","Jules White"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293840000,"objectID":"e31230bf802a246e4ea1920882b282fb","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-200370/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-200370/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A WYSIWYG Approach to Support Layout Configuration in Model Evolution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Michael Gall","Thomas Grechenig","Mogens Bjerre"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293840000,"objectID":"0bf04f5358beea85c31171cde77d1780","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-205874/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-205874/","section":"publication","summary":"In past years ERP Systems have become one of the main components within the corporate IT structure. Several problems exist around implementing and operating these systems within companies. In the literature one can find several studies about the problems arising during the implementation of an ERP system. The main problem areas are around the complexity of ERP systems. One vision to overcome some of these problems is federated ERP. Federated ERP systems are built of components from different vendors, which are distributed within a network. All components act as one single ERP system from the user  perspective. The decreased complexity of such a system would require lower installation and maintenance cost. Additional, only the components which are needed to cover the company´s business processes would be used. Several theories around this concept exist, but a feasibility assessment of developing a federated ERP system has not been done yet. Based on a literary analysis of existing methods for feasibility studies, this paper is applying strategic planning concepts and referential data from the traditional ERP  development to provide a first assessment of the overall feasibility of developing a platform for federated ERP systems. An analytical hierarchical approach is used to define effort and effect related criteria and their domain values. The assessment as the criteria is done in comparison to the development of a classical ERP system. Using the developed criteria, a net present value calculation is done. The calculation of the net present value is done on an overall, not company specific level. In order to estimate the weighted  average cost of capital, the values from successful software companies are used as a baseline. Additional potential risks and obstacles are identified for further clarification.","tags":null,"title":"Assessing the feasibility of developing a federated ERP system","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matthias Baldauf","Peter Fröhlich","Kathrin Masuch","Thomas Grechenig"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293840000,"objectID":"a520e48ae2ebd8f783808cf52299834e","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-195818/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-195818/","section":"publication","summary":"The exploration of the immediate surroundings through mobile location-  aware devices is starting to become an everyday urban activity.

In this paper, we present a modeling language independent conflict model comprising all necessary information to profoundly represent merge conflicts.

However, most of the efforts spent so far concentrated on the improvement on B2C (business-to-consumer) e-commerce applications, achieved by semantic enrichment of information. With the growing importance of Service Oriented Architectures (SOA) companies started to move into the section of the Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), where applications exchange their business information semi-automatically. This B2B (business-to-business) electronic commerce is driven by aligning the internal business processes of companies to publicly available business processes. Thereby companies often do not consider the economic drivers of their business processes, which leads to incompatibilities between management, administration and technical layers. This chapter covers the two major domains of e-business / e-commerce, namely B2B and B2C. In the first, a model-driven approach towards B2B IT solutions is introduced, covering semantic aspects dealing with business models, business process models, and business document models. In the second application domain, the basic concepts of Semantic Web in the area of B2C electronic commerce are examined using a representative example from the e-tourism domain.","tags":null,"title":"eBusiness","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Manuel Wimmer","Gertrude Kappel","Angelika Kusel","Werner Retschitzegger","Johannes Schönböck","Wieland Schwinger"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293840000,"objectID":"155b09adfbe510f253b939ba11fad561","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-196899/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-196899/","section":"publication","summary":"One of the key challenges in the development of model transformations is the resolution of recurring semantic and syntactic heterogeneities.

In this chapter, we summarize our work on a framework for model-based tool integration which is based on well-established conceptual modeling techniques. It allows to design integration models on a conceptual level in terms of UML component diagrams. Not only the design-time is supported by conceptual models, but also the runtime, i.e., the execution of integration models, is represented by conceptual models in terms of Coloured Petri Nets. Furthermore, we show how reusable integration components for resolving structural metamodel heterogeneities, which are one of the most frequently recurring integration problems, can be implemented within our framework.","tags":null,"title":"Leveraging Model-Based Tool Integration by Conceptual Modeling Techniques","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marion Scholz","Konrad Wieland","Christian Huemer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293840000,"objectID":"8e7e765b226855356cad83c8abf39172","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-198729/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-198729/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"New Media in Teaching UML in the Large - an Experience Report","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marion Scholz","Konrad Wieland","Christian Huemer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293840000,"objectID":"4be1017dd47ec2497df3e139662d9057","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-197013/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-197013/","section":"publication","summary":"Huge classes with more than 800 students pose a major challenge to lecturers as well as to students, especially when a practical part is included.

In this paper we suggest a model-driven approach to develop the XML Schemas of input and output messages of Web Services. Since classical data modeling approaches like regular UML class diagrams are not sufficient for modeling business documents, we base our approach on the UN/CEFACT Core Components Technical Specification (CCTS), which does not come with a presentation syntax. Thus, we deliver a UML profile extending class diagrams by CCTS concepts, called UML Profile for Core Components (UPCC). UPCC models are transferred to equivalent XML Schemas following well-defined naming and design rules. In order to allow for an easy search and retrieval of core component business document definitions, a registry is needed. The registry has to handle UPCC models - that are exchanged and stored in XMI - as well as their XML Schema equivalences. In this paper, we extend the ebRIM registry meta model for the special purpose of registering core component artifacts and defining their inter-dependencies.","tags":null,"title":"Registry support for core component-based business document models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Manuel Wimmer","Angelika Kusel","Werner Retschitzegger","Johannes Schönböck","Wieland Schwinger","Jesús Sánchez Cuadrado","Esther Guerra","Juan De Lara"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293840000,"objectID":"0b9a2c455f9ccea15df9a292e1549641","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-200367/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-200367/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Reusing Model Transformations across Heterogeneous Metamodels","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christian Schanes","Stefan Taber","Karin Popp","Florian Fankhauser","Thomas Grechenig"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1293840000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293840000,"objectID":"8d2496038c9589d4c291f2ccf02264ed","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-205417/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-205417/","section":"publication","summary":"Voice over Internet Protocol based systems replace phone lines in many scenarios and are in wide use today.

This requires the presence of several intermediate meta-models between those of the PIM and the PSM. Thus, for achieving the final PSM, a chain of transformation is needed. The solution proposed in this paper is to investigate whether it is possible to generate a single transformation from a chain of transformations, solely involving the initial PIM and final PSM meta-models. The presented work focuses on the composition of algebraic graph transformations at the rule level. Moreover, we discuss about the translation of transformations implemented in dedicated model-to-model transformation languages to algebraic graph transformation specifications. We apply the automatic procedure for composing rules in the context of the evolution of Enterprise Java Beans (EJB), transforming UML models into EJB 2.0 and then to EJB 3.0 models.

From a technical point of view, versioning systems have to face several challenges. Depending on the applied versioning paradigm, functionalities such as synchronous editing, branching, storing different versions, merging, etc. are required. Since much effort has been spent into realizing these tasks, measurable progress has been achieved over the last decades. Unfortunately, a lack of empirical studies exists to find out the actual requirements arising from practice. Therefore, we conducted an online survey and interviewed representative users of versioning systems from academia and industry. Special emphasis is on the versioning of software models, which are nowadays becoming more and more important as there is a trend to model-driven software engineering. The results of our empirical studies show that not all requirements of developers are satisfied by current versioning systems. Especially, more emphasis has to be put on the management of collaborative development, e.g., the division of work and the management of conflicts.","tags":null,"title":"Towards an Understanding of Requirements for Model Versioning Support","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Martin Tomitsch","Florian Sturm","Martin Konzett","Anders Bolin","Isabella Wagner","Thomas Grechenig"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1292198400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1292198400,"objectID":"96ab875916a5674b1a0dd7e24e874cfd","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-193586/","publishdate":"2010-12-13T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-193586/","section":"publication","summary":"In this paper we present results from contextual interviews and observations, which we conducted in Tanzania over a period of six weeks.

Despite of the syntax, the principal approach to develop business document standards has not changed. A standardized business document is built by a superset of all elements that may appear in any business context, leading to overloaded and complex standards. However, in a particular partnership only a small percentage of the elements is used. This results in a top-down approach starting from a generic document and specifying partner-specific subsets. Such an approach is too costly for small and medium-sized enterprises (SME), because agreements on subsets must be implemented in their software systems. As an alternative we suggest a bottom-up solution that starts from a core set of elements, representing the intersection of all industry contexts. Thereby, the core set may be extended to incorporate the needs of a specific business context. In this paper we examine different mechanisms provided by XML Schema to realize such an extension. The applicability of the different mechanisms is evaluated by means of the Austrian e-Invoicing standard ebInterface, which we co-authored.","tags":null,"title":"A bottom-up approach to build XML business document standards","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Maximilian Ronniger","Florian Fankhauser","Christian Schanes","Thomas Grechenig"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1289174400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1289174400,"objectID":"84a2bb527df772885b1130f7972e995f","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-193437/","publishdate":"2010-11-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-193437/","section":"publication","summary":"Voice over IP (VoIP) is in wide use today, replacing  phone lines in many scenarios.

The main ob jective  of the approach is the evaluation of service availability of a  System Under Test (SUT) during security attacks, e.g., De-  nial of Service (DoS) attacks. Therefore, a simulated system  load based on QoS requirements is combined with di\u0026#64256;erent  security attacks. The observation of the system is based  on black-box testing. By monitoring quality metrics of SIP  transactions the behavior of the system is measurable. The  concept was realized as a prototype and was evaluated using  di\u0026#64256;erent VoIP systems. For this, multiple security attacks  are integrated to the testing scenarios. The outcome showed  that the concept provides sound test results, which re\u0026#64258;ect  the behavior of SIP systems availability under various at-  tacks. Thus, security problems can be found and QoS for  SIP-based VoIP communication under attack can be pre-  dicted.","tags":null,"title":"Work in progress: Black-Box approach for testing quality of service in case of security incidents on the example of a SIP-based VoIP service","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter Leitner","Thomas Grechenig"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1280361600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1280361600,"objectID":"a99da949e08082f1d64dde6530beeacf","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-193452/","publishdate":"2010-07-29T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-193452/","section":"publication","summary":"The fast growth of social media is moving on and new records are continually published from the world of Facebook, Twitter \u0026 Co. The big success of several social media services leads to its strong use by the internet community to communicate, collaborate and interact in private and professional life. Many companies have already realized the high potential of the social web and are successfully applying such innovative services to achieve a higher efficiency by optimizing internal and external processes. Social web services are especially suited for marketing and communication activities as strong tool to interact with customers and other stakeholders. However, many companies haven´t yet realized the extensive power of the web community. Thus, many marketing and communication campaigns failed right from the beginning or in the worst case even caused negative effects on them. This paper discusses different strategies how to use the social web for business and points out the potential pitfalls and risks based on representative case studies. The selected cases illustrate potential negative consequences like image damage or financial loss and the dynamics within the web community.

Agreement among personnel from different enterprises as well as distributed computing issues are major challenges to the automation of B2Bi processes. These challenges can be addressed by applying the choreography language ebXML BPSS (ebBP) for declaratively specifying B2Bi processes and using Web services and WS-BPEL as dedicated integration technologies. ebBP Business Transactions (BT) are the primary building block of ebBP choreographies and specify the exchange of up to two business documents in a declarative and technology-agnostic way. Composing BTs within choreographies and realization of QoS raise important requirements for the orchestration layer.

A prerequisite, for fostering the interoperability between business partners utilizing different business document standards, is a mapping between different standards. However, the effort involved in creating those mappings is hard to estimate. For example, the complexity of standardized formats is one crucial aspect affecting the effort of the mapping process. Therefore, a notion of complexity is desirable for both, manual as well as automatic mapping processes. For this reason we develop an initial set of metrics, based on well established metrics for XML Schema, allowing to analyze the complexity of business document standards. Having such metrics at hand allows estimating the complexity and hence the mapping effort of a business document standard, prior to the actual mapping process.

Considering the saturation levels attained today with mobile devices and the ability to be Internet connected, the stage has been set to integrate those devices into the classroom. An investigation was conducted to include the efficient integration of smart phones in everyday learning considering didactic, organizational, and technical concepts. Research was initiated by collecting and categorizing potential scenarios in which mobile phones could be productively used, and analyzing scenarios for virtual teams. A Q\u0026A Game was selected with the didactical goal to enhance the students' comprehension for a complicated subject matter. 24 students from a 6th grade secondary school (11-12 years old, 50% males, 50% females) who were familiar with Internet services participated in the test which was conducted at their school. It was astonishing how fast, trouble free, and smoothly they gathered the skills to accomplish the required tasks. The students showed not only an overall enthusiasm for the devices, but also explicitly for the teaching methods. Several critical success factors for the efficient use of smart phones in classes were then enumerated. The results indicated that smart phones are an efficient way to realize virtual teams in educational environments offering a wide variety of ways to support virtual teams in learning scenarios. In this paper technical and didactical recommendations that can be used to plan smart phone supported virtual team scenarios are presented.","tags":null,"title":"Mobile enabling of virtual teams in school: An observational study on smart phone application in secondary education","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Stefan Bachl","Martin Tomitsch","Christoph Wimmer","Thomas Grechenig"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1276992000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1276992000,"objectID":"7ba71a77fbaf135a44dcbef0473da932","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-193407/","publishdate":"2010-06-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-193407/","section":"publication","summary":"Advances in technology have led to an increased presence  of multi-touch interfaces in consumer products in recent  years.

This helps us to quickly adapt the B2B processes to changing requirements without the need to change the overall architecture. In this paper we provide a mapping from REA, which represents one of the most prominent ontologies for business modeling, to UMM (UN/CEFACT's Modeling Methodology), a standardized methodology for modeling the global choreography of interorganizational business processes.

Although numerous approaches are available, they lack convenient facilities for supporting debugging and understanding of the transformation logic. This is because execution engines operate on a low level of abstraction, hide the operational semantics of a transformation, scatter metamodels, models, transformation logic, and trace information across different artifacts, and provide limited verification support. To tackle these problems, we propose a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) on top of Colored Petri Nets (CPNs)-called Transformation Nets-for the execution and debugging of model transformations on a high level of abstraction. This formalism makes the afore hidden operational semantics explicit by providing a runtime model in terms of places, transitions and tokens, integrating all artifacts involved into a homogenous view.

Especially in early project phases, when software models are typically employed for brainstorming, analysis, and design purposes, such an approach bears the danger of losing important viewpoints of different stakeholders and domain engineers, resulting in a lower quality of the overall system specification. In this paper, we propose conflict-tolerant model versioning to overcome this problem.

A common approach to circumvent the problem is to map these models to more formal representations. In this context, many works propose a rule-based approach to automatically translate behavioral models like SD into colored Petri nets (CPN). However, finding the rules for such SD-to-CPN transformations manually may be difficult, as the transformation rules are usually not obviously defined. We propose a solution that starts from the hypothesis that examples of good transformation of SD-to-CPN can be useful to automatically generate transformation rules. To this end, we describe an automated approach to find the rules that best match the meta-model elements of SD to corresponding elements in the CPN meta-model. Thus, our approach starts by randomly generating a set of rules, executing them to generate some target models. Then, it evaluates the quality of the proposed solution (rules) by comparing the generated target models to the expected ones in the base of examples. In this case, the search space is large and heuristic-search is needed. To achieve our goal, we combine two algorithms for global and local search, namely Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and Simulated Annealing (SA). Our empirical results show that the generated rules derive CPNs similar to the expected ones.","tags":null,"title":"Generating transformation rules from examples for behavioral models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Philip Langer","Manuel Wimmer","Gertrude Kappel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1262304000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1262304000,"objectID":"680d68be439f9d0c01d17a7840258e16","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-186624/","publishdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-186624/","section":"publication","summary":"During the last decade several approaches have been proposed for easing the burden of writing model transformation rules manually.

In this paper, we extend our MTBD approach, which is designed for in-place transformations, to also support M2M transformations. In particular, we propose to demonstrate each transformation rule by modeling a source model fragment and a corresponding target model fragment.

Metamodel evolution and model co-evolution are considered to be essential ingredients for the successful adoption of model-driven engineering in practice. In this respect, on the one hand, dedicated co-evolution languages have been proposed for migrating models conforming to an initial metamodel to models conforming to a revised metamodel with the drawback of requiring to learn a new language. On the other hand, the employment of dedicated model-to-model transformation languages has been proposed demanding for the speci cation of rules for copying unchanged elements.  In this paper, we propose to tackle the co-evolution problem from a di erent viewpoint. Instead of describing the co-evolution of models as a transformation between two metamodels, we employ existing inplace transformation languages. For this, the prerequisite is to represent both language versions within one metamodel which is automatically computed by merging the initial and the revised metamodel. This ensures that the initial as well as the revised model conform to the merged metamodel, enabling the employment of inplace transformations for initializing new metamodel elements. Finally, a check-out transformation is used for eliminating model elements which are no longer covered by the revised metamodel.We demonstrate this idea by using ATL for merging the metamodels and realizing the check-out transformation. Furthermore, we discuss the ATL re nement mode for co-evolving the models.","tags":null,"title":"On using Inplace Transformations for Model Co-evolution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Manuel Wimmer","Gertrude Kappel","Angelika Kusel","Werner Retschitzegger","Johannes Schönböck","Wieland Schwinger"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1262304000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1262304000,"objectID":"8b1371ce084dcf524f4c541da1f7ff1b","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-188263/","publishdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-188263/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Plug \u0026 Play Model Transformations - A DSL for Resolving Structural Metamodel Heterogeneities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Birgit Hofreiter","Kuo-Ming Chao","Christian Huemer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1262304000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1262304000,"objectID":"bb8a875b9d613eb8ef1663cd8baddf3f","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-203399/","publishdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-203399/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Proceedings of the 12th IEEE Conference on Commerce and Enterprise Computing (CEC 2010)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christian Pichler","Philip Langer","Manuel Wimmer","Christian Huemer","Birgit Hofreiter"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1262304000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1262304000,"objectID":"7167ba032ec0ec16fc2896d98e5231ba","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-192535/","publishdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-192535/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Registry Support for Core Component Evolution","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Petra Kaufmann","Horst Kargl","Philip Langer","Martina Seidl","Konrad Wieland","Manuel Wimmer","Gertrude Kappel"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1262304000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1262304000,"objectID":"d50756c6497c9700e0fc1d321baf1e3b","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-188123/","publishdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-188123/","section":"publication","summary":"The urgent demand for optimistic version control support for software models induced active research within the modeling community.

For specifying the operational semantics of the MOPs, we propose to use Transformation Nets (TNs), a DSL on top of Colored Petri Nets (CPNs), since it allows (i) to keep the impedance mismatch between specification and execution low and (ii) to analyze model transformations by evaluating behavioral properties of CPNs.","tags":null,"title":"Taming the Shrew - Resolving Structural Heterogeneities with Hierarchical CPN","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gertrude Kappel","Johannes Schönböck","Manuel Wimmer","Gabriele Kotsis","Angelika Kusel","Birgit Pröll","Werner Retschitzegger","Wieland Schwinger","Stephan Lechner"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1262304000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1262304000,"objectID":"5153eb5063994214a84fa9b4fb2fa63c","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-186732/","publishdate":"2010-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-186732/","section":"publication","summary":"Social networks have seen enormous growth over the past few years, providing also a powerful new channel for distributing personalized services.

Thus, most of the effort is needed to define a transformation mechanism for each intermediate step. The solution proposed in this paper is to investigate whether it is possible to generate a single transformation from a chain of transformations, solely involving the initial PIM and final PSM meta-models.

As a prerequisite for convenient debugging, TROPIC provides a homogeneous view on all artifacts of a transformation on basis of a single formalism. Besides that, this formalism also provides a runtime model, thus making the afore hidden operational semantics of the transformation explicit.

(Kennerley and Neely, 2002; Dumslaff, 1994; Stefanou, 2001) However, these criteria are usually on a very detailed technical level and are based primarily on the requirements of larger companies. (Illa et al.,  2000; Verville and Halingten, 2002). It is therefore difficult for small and medium-size enterprises, which have other requirements, to use these criteria to decide upon a particular system. This paper defines a specific class of companies, \"orchestra companies\", which fall into the category of small and medium size enterprises. A key aspect of an orchestra company is the fact that it does not gain direct value from its IT systems; the IT equipment in the company is only an operating resource. These companies do not have their own IT departments and decisions regarding ERP selection are usually made by the decision makers directly without a long and expensive selection process. (Barbacci, 2002) On the basis of the definition and needs of orchestra companies, criteria for  the comparison of ERP systems specific to this company class have been developed. Based on a literary analysis of existing methods for the comparison of ERP systems, the criteria for orchestra companies are identified and modified. The target audiences are IT managers and decision makers who can use these criteria during the ERP selection process to get qualitative metrics as a basis for the choice of a system. The validation of the developed criteria hasBusiness One 2007.","tags":null,"title":"Technical Criteria for the Comparison of Modern ERP Systems for Usage in Orchestra Companies","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Philipp Liegl","Christian Huemer","Marco Zapletal"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1252886400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1252886400,"objectID":"0efcb2bb9bda1340bdd000f597eb9aac","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-177763/","publishdate":"2009-09-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-177763/","section":"publication","summary":"In the field of business document standardization a multitude of different standardization efforts exist. Unfortunately, most of the developed standards are designed for a specific application domain or industry and do not consider cross-standard interoperability. This results in several incompatible standard definitions. Without the provision of a common semantical basis for business document definitions, cross-domain interoperability cannot be achieved.  In this paper we provide a methodology for building a global reference ontology based on the Core Components Technical Specification (CCTS) and Web Ontology Language (OWL). Using our approach a common semantic business document basis is developed. New document definitions may be derived from this basis and existing document definitions may be aligned to it. Using our 'derivation-by-restriction' mechanism, instances derived from a common semantical basis are interoperable to each other.

This commit carries the inherent danger of losing the modifications of the other developer. Recently, collaborative merge approaches for code versioning systems have been proposed to minimize this risk. In this paper we propose to apply similar techniques in the context of model versioning where the challenge of merging two versions is even more formidable due to their graph-structure and their rich semantics.

Consequently, requirements engineering for SOAs must focus on business processes and on their integration into systems using interoperable services, which is not the case for most conventional requirements engineering approaches. In this paper we present a requirements engineering approach specifically designed for the engineering of SOAs. Requirements are captured using a unified process, based on phases and iterations eventually leading to a formalized and unambiguous requirements specification. The final requirements specification can be used in succeeding development phases - i.e. for the model-driven generation of deployment artifacts for SOAs.

However the low-level engines employed to execute transformations lead to an impedance mismatch between specification and execution of model transformations which hampers debugging. Additionally, current approaches lack of appropriate reuse mechanisms for resolving recurring transformation problems. Therefore, we propose a process-oriented specification and execution of model transformations based on Transformation Nets, a variant of Colored Petri Nets (CPNs). By using Transformation Nets, the benefits of imperative and declarative approaches are combined, not only for the specification of model transformations, but also for their execution by using CPNs themselves as a transformation engine.

In our session we will present an ECLIPSE integrated code review plug-in, which helps developers to review the source code efficient on a per changeset basis - the item under inspection is one changeset in the revision control system.  The tight integration of the review plug-in into the ECLIPSE development environment helps the developer to accept the review task as his daily work, like debugging or re-factoring.  Because of its simple design it's possible to initiate the review process on any existing project in a few minutes. All review data is stored within files, shared with the already configured subversion repository of your project. So there is no need to setup any server-side application, apart from the already existing subversion repository. The reviewer uses a special review editor to inspect the changesets, compares different versions of a file with the compare editor, and leaves his rating and optional comments for the commiter of the changeset. The review editor aligns with the basic concepts of the ECLIPSE environment,  so the initial training will consume little time. Here are some features of the ECLIPSE plug-in:  Easy to use review editor  Easy installation and configuration, no server-side application needed  Flexible Author/Reviewer assignments, supporting different types of reviewing (Peer vs. Master)  Assignments may be scheduled within periods, supporting review iterations  Re-use of the Compare-Editor to show file differences between revisions  Enhanced Review-Editor to manage assignments and code reviews  An extended version of the review plugin, based on the ECLIPSE Collaboration Framework, further provides notifications, e.g. about new review comments.  The Vienna University of Technology uses this review plug-in for many software development projects.  The flexible design allows to use different types of review models, whichever fits best into your software engineering process. The assignments may be done in a peer to peer manner, where the developers inspect the code changes of one or more team members. Reading each others code has the consequence, that developers also learn the code from their colleagues, thus supporting collective code ownership. As a result, a better code sharing and reuse will be more likely, the team's interaction and creativity will be  encouraged. A more hierarchical approach would be to assign a senior developer to review the code for new or less experienced developers. The senior developer in the role of the reviewer may enforce coding standards and better code quality within the development team.  Because of our positive experience with the plug-in and the good feedback we have received, we will release the review plug-in under an open-source license prior to the EclipseCon 2009.","tags":null,"title":"ReviewClipse - Supporting Code-Reviews within the Eclipse IDE","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter Leitner","Thomas Grechenig"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1235606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1235606400,"objectID":"773a00a1221acb3d7cb9dac86130fe44","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-184288/","publishdate":"2009-02-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-184288/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Club-, Live- und Video-Shopping: Die Eroberung des Onlinehandels durch innovative Social Commerce Konzepte","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gerald Fischer","Thomas Grechenig","Bernhard Horn","Roman Trabitsch","Johann Wachter"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1235606400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1235606400,"objectID":"d9cc9e7098781e2e8e77b74fbc730a12","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-184284/","publishdate":"2009-02-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-184284/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Semantisches Web und Soziales Web im Recht","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter Leitner","Thomas Grechenig"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1235520000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1235520000,"objectID":"d68ca940492778fea7a6ca4c42d6804f","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-183625/","publishdate":"2009-02-25T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-183625/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Social Online Shopping: Neue Formen der Interaktion und Kollaboration im Electronic Commerce der Zukunft","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter Leitner","Thomas Grechenig"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1231113600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1231113600,"objectID":"8e0ac3596eb9155b444b2052ada6ee7d","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-183619/","publishdate":"2009-01-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-183619/","section":"publication","summary":"The common use and variety of social software services has rapidly increased over the past years. The big success of established services like Facebook, Twitter or YouTube accelerates the transformation of the whole web. Next generation services are characterized by strong social interaction and collaboration tools. Significantly affected by this movement, conventional commerce platforms and online shops are gradually substituted by social shopping communities. Social commerce allows consumers to collaborate online, to exchange information about products and to get advice from trusted individuals. This paper introduces a scalable social software service model for an online shopping community built under consideration of existing best practice services. The model combines features of social networking, online shopping and social commerce sites. We present comparative analyses of these three service categories, significant showcases as well as the creation process of the model itself. The designed framework serves as basis for both service developers and researchers.","tags":null,"title":"Scalable Social Software Services: Towards a Shopping Community Model Based on Analyses of Established Web Service Components and Functions","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Manuel Wimmer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1230768000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1230768000,"objectID":"b1df9c58d5f21a168813665caa28e678","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-177412/","publishdate":"2009-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-177412/","section":"publication","summary":"Purpose - The definition of modeling languages is a key-prerequisite for model-driven engineering. In this respect, Domain-Specific Modeling Languages (DSMLs) defined from scratch in terms of metamodels and the extension of Unified Modeling Language (UML) by profiles are the proposed options. For interoperability reasons, however, the need arises to bridge modeling languages originally defined as DSMLs to UML. Therefore, the paper aims to propose a semi-automatic approach for bridging DSMLs and UML by employing model-driven techniques.  Design/methodology/approach - The paper discusses problems of the ad hoc integration of DSMLs and UML and from this discussion a systematic and semi-automatic integration approach consisting of two phases is derived. In the first phase, the correspondences between the modeling concepts of the DSML and UML are defined manually. In the second phase, these correspondences are used for automatically producing UML profiles to represent the domain-specific modeling concepts in UML and model transformations for transforming DSML models to UML models and vice versa. The paper presents the ideas within a case study for bridging ComputerAssociate's DSML of the AllFusion Gen CASE tool with IBM's Rational Software Modeler for UML.  Findings - The ad hoc definition of UML profiles and model transformations for achieving interoperability is typically a tedious and error-prone task. By employing a semi-automatic approach one gains several advantages. First, the integrator only has to deal with the correspondences between the DSML and UML on a conceptual level. Second, all repetitive integration tasks are automated by using model transformations. Third, well-defined guidelines support the systematic and comprehensible integration.  Research limitations/implications - The paper focuses on the integrating direction DSMLs to UML, but not on how to derive a DSML defined in terms of a metamodel from a UML profile.  Originality/value - Although, DSMLs defined as metamodels and UML profiles are frequently applied in practice, only few attempts have been made to provide interoperability between these two worlds. The contribution of this paper is to integrate the so far competing worlds of DSMLs and UML by proposing a semi-automatic approach, which allows exchanging models between these two worlds without loss of information.","tags":null,"title":"A semi-automatic approach for bridging DSMLs with UML","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Kerstin Altmanninger","Martina Seidl","Manuel Wimmer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1230768000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1230768000,"objectID":"13a4a541ee0092826addd7171f88f116","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-177366/","publishdate":"2009-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-177366/","section":"publication","summary":"Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to provide a feature-based characterization of version control systems (VCSs), providing an overview about the state-of-the-art of versioning systems dedicated to modeling artifacts.

UN/CEFACT´s modeling methodology (UMM) is a Unified Modeling Language (UML) profile for developing B2B processes. The formalisms introduced by UMM´s stereotypes facilitate the communication with the software engineers. However, business experts-who usually have a very limited understanding of UML-prefer expressing their thoughts and evaluating the results by plain text descriptions. In this paper,we describe an approach that presents an equivalent of theUMMstereotypes and tagged values in text-based templates called worksheets. This strong alignment allows an integration into a UMM modeling tool and ensures consistency. We show how a specially designed XML-based worksheet definition language allows customization to special needs of certain business domains. Furthermore, we demonstrate how information kept in worksheets may be used for the semi-automatic generation of pattern-based UMM artifacts which are later transformed to web service definition language and business process execution language code.","tags":null,"title":"B2B Services: Worksheet-Driven Development of Modeling Artifacts and Code","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Petra Kaufmann","Martina Seidl","Konrad Wieland","Manuel Wimmer","Philip Langer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1230768000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1230768000,"objectID":"1fa459e6788d3de3410bcdd196e81134","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-178419/","publishdate":"2009-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-178419/","section":"publication","summary":"We present configuration mechanisms based on by-example approaches for the adaptable model versioning system AMOR improving the complete versioning workflow.

In order to fully exploit the potential of MDE, modeling tools must work in combination, i.e., a seamless exchange of models between different modeling tools is crucial for MDE.

This book proposes a comprehensive approach for realizing model-based tool integration. In cases where metamodel descriptions are missing, a semi-automatic approach for mining metamodels and models from textual language definitions is presented. For raising the level of abstraction and for ensuring the reuse of mappings between metamodels, a framework is proposed for building, applying, and executing reusable mapping operators.

To tackle these limitations we propose a framework called TROPIC (Transformations on Petri Nets in Color) providing a DSL on top of Colored Petri Nets (CPNs) to specify, simulate, and formally verify model transformations. The formal underpinnings of CPNs enables simulation and veri fication of model transformations. By exploring the constructed state space of CPNs we show how prede fined behavioral properties as well as custom state space functions can be applied for observing and tracking origins of errors during debugging.","tags":null,"title":"Right or Wrong? - Verification of Model Transformations using Colored Petri Nets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christian Huemer","Philipp Liegl","Rainer Schuster","Marco Zapletal","Birgit Hofreiter"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1230768000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1230768000,"objectID":"8d086bc341fa4ce0075e141137af3987","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-178388/","publishdate":"2009-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-178388/","section":"publication","summary":"This chapter concentrates on the modeling and analysis of enterprises that collaborate in a service oriented world.

The task is to make people more aware of their water consumption. This awareness is necessary to change one´s water consumption behavior and consequently be able to save water in the long term.  Problems with existing water meters are, on the one hand, the place they are installed in. In general, they are not easily accessible and thus the meter is seldom read off. On the other hand, reading these meters requires a high cognitive load. Therefore, conventional meters cannot deliver appropriate direct feedback.  The suggested solution proposes the usage of ambient displays directly in the spatial context of water consumption. The advantage of ambient displays is that they are aesthetically pleasing objects and deliver feedback in an unobtrusive and subtle way.  The application developed addresses the daily morning shower. Since this shower can take from 3 up to 30 minutes, there is great potential of creating awareness and saving water. Through the use of an ambient display, the imaginary water level if the drain was closed can be visualized. This can help to create a perception of how much water is actually consumed.","tags":null,"title":"From Feedback to Awareness: An Ambient Water Consumption Display","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christian Huemer","Philipp Liegl","Thomas Motal","Rainer Schuster","Marco Zapletal"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1219104000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1219104000,"objectID":"13e02c2e5cc2be5dc20908489dabc83b","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-166115/","publishdate":"2008-08-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-166115/","section":"publication","summary":"The development of inter-organizational systems requires a well defined development process.

Blogs, social networks or user generated media platforms demonstrate the broad range of such social sites. According to these phenomenons, classic e-shops are changing more and more to functional-rich communities with a strong consumer focus. This paper illustrates a model of a consumer centric community (CCC) which allows customers to collaborate within a social commerce environment.

Therefore, Model Transformation By-Example (MTBE) approaches for defining inter-model mappings, that represent semantic correspondences between concrete domain models, have been proposed. However, until today no tool support for MTBE has been developed.  The contribution of this paper is the presentation of MTBE concepts, which are necessary to derive general model transformations based on the metamodels from mappings between example models. More specifically, we describe a model and a metamodel mapping language, as well as reasoning algorithms to infer metamodel mappings from model mappings.

Current best practices use model transformation languages to realize necessary mappings between concepts of the metamodels defining the modeling languages supported by different tools. Existing model transformation languages, however, lack appropriate abstraction mechanisms for resolving recurring kinds of structural heterogeneities one has to primarily cope with when creating such mappings. We propose a framework for building reusable mapping operators which allow the automatic transformation of models. For each mapping operator, the operational semantics is specified on basis of Colored Petri Nets, providing a uniform formalism not only for representing the transformation logic together with the metamodels and the models themselves, but also for executing the transformations, thus facilitating understanding and debugging. To demonstrate the applicability of our approach, we apply the proposed framework for defining a set of mapping operators which are intended to resolve typical structural heterogeneities occurring between the core concepts usually used to define metamodels.","tags":null,"title":"A Framework for Building Mapping Operators Resolving Structural Heterogeneities","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Martin Tomitsch","Thomas Grechenig","Andrew Vande Moere"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1205884800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1205884800,"objectID":"956e366ceb3158d54c64080ac37d7adf","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-172374/","publishdate":"2008-03-19T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-172374/","section":"publication","summary":"We propose a conceptual design framework for the  classification and design of applications that augment  architectural environments with digital information.

In this paper, we present our Web 2.0 MetaModelbrowser, a model visualization service which provides an Ajax-based tree-viewer for efficiently browsing Ecore-based metamodels and their models. As a main contribution of this work the MetaModelbrowser is complementary to existing model repositories in that its visualization service can be integrated into them. The MetaModelbrowser, furthermore, allows zooming in and out of the details of arbitrarily sized models as necessary. Furthermore, we have done some case studies on the one hand how to extend the MetaModelbrowser, e.g., for creation, update, and deletion of model elements as well as supporting model weaving, and on the other hand how to incorporate the MetaModelbrowser in current versioning systems.","tags":null,"title":"How Web 2.0 can leverage Model Engineering in Practice","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Horst Kargl","Manuel Wimmer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1204588800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1204588800,"objectID":"e09de0330f2e782167eb9b08a8a847db","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-141745/","publishdate":"2008-03-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-141745/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"SmartMatcher - How Examples and a Dedicated Mapping Language can Improve the Quality of Automatic Matching Approaches","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christian Huemer","Philipp Liegl","Rainer Schuster","Hannes Werthner","Marco Zapletal"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1203984000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1203984000,"objectID":"4791a05d4a5cf50de2b70941c8838234","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-141766/","publishdate":"2008-02-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-141766/","section":"publication","summary":"Inter-organizational systems have significantly been affected by Service-oriented Architectures (SOA) andWeb Services - the state-of-the-art technology to implement SOA. SOA is said to enable quick and inexpensive changes of the IT in order to establish new business partnerships or to reflect changes in existing partnerships. However, current approaches to inter-organizational systems focus too much on existing Web Services standards and, thus, on the technology layer. In such an approach the technology drives the business. In this paper we analyze the shortcomings of this bottom-up approach. As an alternative we suggest a top-down methodology where the business requirements drive the technology. This methodology starts off with the business value perspective, leading to a business process perspective and resulting in an IT execution perspective. We do not invent any new approaches on each of these layers, rather we outline how existing approaches are used and combined into a business requirements driven approach to inter-organizational systems.","tags":null,"title":"Inter-organizational Systems: From Business Values over Business Processes to Deployment","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter Leitner","Thomas Grechenig"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1203552000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1203552000,"objectID":"41e11611c9f35782bb85a3c7f9429f12","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-183623/","publishdate":"2008-02-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-183623/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Shopping 2.0: Internethandel im Zeitalter von Crowdsourcing, Consumer Generated Content und Widgets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wieland Schwinger","Werner Retschitzegger","Andrea Schauerhuber","Gertrude Kappel","Manuel Wimmer","Birgit Pröll","Cristina Castro Cachero","Sven Casteleyn","Olga De Troyer","Piero Fraternali","Irene Garrigos","Franca Garzotto","Athula Ginige","Geert-Jan Houben","Nora Koch","Nathalie Moreno","Oscar Pastor","Paolo Paolini","Vicente Ferragud Pelechano","Gustavo Rossi","Daniel Schwabe","Massimo Tisi","Antonio Vallecillo","Kees van der Sluijs","Gefei Zhang"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1199145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1199145600,"objectID":"14b9962b98ebcb4ef5da581057d566f9","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-167154/","publishdate":"2008-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-167154/","section":"publication","summary":"Ubiquitous web applications (UWA) are a new type of web applications which are accessed in various contexts, i.e. through different devices, by users with various interests, at anytime from anyplace around the globe. For such full-fledged, complex software systems, a methodologically sound engineering approach in terms of model-driven engineering (MDE) is crucial. Several modeling approaches have already been proposed that capture the ubiquitous nature of web applications, each of them having different origins, pursuing different goals and providing a pantheon of concepts. This paper aims to give an in-depth comparison of seven modeling approaches supporting the development of UWAs. This methodology is conducted by applying a detailed set of evaluation criteria and by demonstrating its applicability on basis of an exemplary tourism web application. In particular, five commonly found ubiquitous scenarios are investigated, thus providing initial insight into the modeling concepts of each approach as well as to facilitate their comparability. The results gained indicate that many modeling approaches lack a proper MDE foundation in terms of meta-models and tool support. The proposed modeling mechanisms for ubiquity are often limited, since they neither cover all relevant context factors in an explicit, self-contained, and extensible way, nor allow for a wide spectrum of extensible adaptation operations. The provided modeling concepts frequently do not allow dealing with all different parts of a web application in terms of its content, hypertext, and presentation levels as well as their structural and behavioral features. Finally, current modeling approaches do not reflect the crosscutting nature of ubiquity but rather intermingle context and adaptation issues with the core parts of a web application, thus hampering maintainability and extensibility. Different from other surveys in the area of modeling web applications, this paper specifically considers modeling concepts for their ubiquitous nature, together with an investigation of available support for MDD in a comprehensive way, using a well-defined as well as fine-grained catalogue of more than 30 evaluation criteria.","tags":null,"title":"A survey on web modeling approaches for ubiquitous web applications","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Klaus-Dieter Naujok","Christian Huemer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1199145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1199145600,"objectID":"aa211d53590cc3414b241515fc9d6aa5","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-141742/","publishdate":"2008-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-141742/","section":"publication","summary":"In 1999 UN/CEFACT and OASIS started the ebXML Initiative which delivered its first set of specifications 2 years later.

A wide variety of modeling tools is already available supporting different development tasks and advocating different modeling languages. In order to fully exploit the potential of MDE, modeling tools must work in combination, i.e., a seamless exchange of models between different modeling tools is crucial for MDE. Current best practices to achieve interoperability use model transformation languages to realize necessary mappings between the metamodels defining the modeling languages supported by different tools. However, the development of such mappings is still done in an ad-hoc and implementation-oriented manner which simply does not scale for large integration scenarios. The reason for this is twofold. First, various modeling languages are not based on metamodeling standards but instead define proprietary languages rather focused on notational aspects. And second, existing model transformation languages both do not support expressing mappings on a high-level of abstraction and lack appropriate reuse mechanisms for already existing integration knowledge.   This thesis contributes to the above mentioned problems. It proposes a comprehensive approach for realizing model-based tool integration, which is inspired from techniques originating from the field of database integration, but employed in the context of MDE. For tackling the problem of missing metamodel descriptions, a semi-automatic approach for mining metamodels and models from textual language definitions is presented, being a prerequisite for the subsequent steps which are based on metamodels and models, only. For raising the level of abstraction and for ensuring the reuse of mappings between metamodels, a framework is proposed for building, applying, and executing reusable mapping operators. To demonstrate the applicability of the framework, it is applied to the definition of mapping operators which are intended to resolve typical structural heterogeneities occurring between the core concepts of metamodels. Finally, for ensuring roundtrip capabilities of transformations, two approaches are proposed evolving non-roundtripping transformations with roundtrip capabilities.","tags":null,"title":"From Mining to Mapping and Roundtrip Transformations - A Systematic Approach to Model-based Tool Integration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Rainer Simon","Peter Fröhlich","Thomas Grechenig"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1199145600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1199145600,"objectID":"7cb70ffc1cb11ceca683a352692a99b0","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-195819/","publishdate":"2008-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-195819/","section":"publication","summary":"The growing trend towards mobile phones with integrated GPS clearly suggests that navigation and location-based services (LBS) will be key applications for future mobile devices.

This need arises, on one hand, from the fact that there are many different business process modeling formalisms, for example the ADONIS Standard Modeling Method , UML 2.1 Activity Diagram, the Event-driven Process Chain Method, and, the Business Process Modeling Notation. These formalisms provide different ways to express and represent the same aspects of business process modeling. On the other hand, existing model transformation approaches, like ATL, QVT, and Fujaba, use very general concepts for transforming models for different purposes. However, recurring structures have been observed when transforming models in the area of business process modeling. This leads to the assumption, that there are similar transformation problems in a distinct area. These recurring structures, however, are only inadequately supported by existing transformation approaches.  This thesis analyzes the different ways of how business process modeling aspects are represented in various business process modeling formalisms. Furthermore, existing transformation approaches are evaluated concerning their suitability for transforming models in the area of business process modeling. Based on this evaluation, special requirements and solutions for model transformations in the area of business process modeling are derived. These solutions lead to the construction of the Model Morphing approach, which consists of an integrated metamodel and morphing methods which operate based on this metamodel. The Model Morphing approach makes it possible to concentrate on the specific transformation problems within a distinct domain. Furthermore, it reuses existing model transformation approaches and reduces the need for excellent programming skills when defining model transformations.","tags":null,"title":"The Model Morphing Approach - Horizontal Transformation of Business Process Models","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Peter Leitner","Thomas Grechenig"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1196985600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1196985600,"objectID":"e68479cb5192458fc302e8ab34b32083","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-141550/","publishdate":"2007-12-07T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-141550/","section":"publication","summary":"The fast evolution of the internet has tremendously increased the variety of modern communication possibilities for people, offering new sources for social contacts via communities and networks.

The buzzword web 2.0 became a synonym for this evolution which has enormously increased communication possibilities among people by enabling them to stay in touch via communities, blogs and social networks. In the same way B2C and C2C e-commerce rapidly changed within the last years. Users were integrated into existing online shops and mutated from a simple buyer to a fully integrated customer. Thus, a modern shop visitor can recommend products, leave comments, rate vendors or publish wish lists. This recent phenomenon, called social commerce or social shopping, leads to more customer satisfaction, loyalty and consequently to more revenue for the vendor. Accordingly, there is a strong demand for innovative e-commerce models and new shopping functionalities. Currently, only few vendors succeeded to launch new platforms and services,but market researchers confirm the economically expanding value of innovative user driven e-commerce solutions. In the near future, social shopping features might become a must-have for every modern shop owner. This paper presents the results of an extended case study research on future B2C and C2C e-commerce models.

Up to now, MTBE approaches have been applied to structural models, only. In this work we apply MTBE to the domain of business process modeling languages, i.e., Event-driven Process Chains and UML activity diagrams. Compared to structural languages, business process modeling languages cover static semantic constraints, which are not specified in the metamodel. As a consequence, reasoning on the abstract syntax level is not sufficient. The contribution of this paper is to extend our existing MTBE approach by new alignment operators on the user level, which further improves the transparency of model transformation code.

Modeling interorganizational business processes is necessary in order to gain a profound and unique representation of the processes involved.

The United Nation´s Center for Trade Facilitation and Electronic Business (UN/CEFACT) took up the challenge and started to develop such a methodology. The research efforts became known as UN/CEFACT´s modeling methodology (UMM) [1]. UMM enables the business modeler to capture the business knowledge independent of the underlying implementation technology such as ebXML or Web Services. Due to the popularity of the Unified Modeling Language (UML) the UMM is built on top of it. UMM is defined as a UML profile - i.e. a set of stereotypes, tagged values and constraints - in order to customize the UML meta model for the specific purpose of modeling the collaborative space in B2B. Although the standard is well developed and documented, its complexity and mightiness make it difficult for the novice user to perceive from scratch. Therefore a tool, supporting themodeler in creating a validUMMmodel would help those inexperienced with UMM.We have developed such a plug-in for the UML modeling tool Enterprise Architect 1 called UMM Add-In 2.We highlight the main features of the Add-In and show how the tool facilitates the use of the methodology.","tags":null,"title":"UMM Add-In: A UML Extension for UN/CEFACT's Modeling Methodology","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Martin Tomitsch","Thomas Grechenig"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1189900800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1189900800,"objectID":"8c4566a87e7233b2a05c7d187265e750","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-141556/","publishdate":"2007-09-16T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-141556/","section":"publication","summary":"The ceiling represents an unexplored domain that will soon be available as information space due to advances in technology.

The agreements and commitments between the partner require a certain order in the flow of business documents. This flow - commonly known as choreography - often depends on the actual content of a business document. E.g. the next step depends on whether a price was stated in a quote document or not in the step before. These characteristics usually affect the states of a business entity - whether a quote is in state provided or in state refused. The states of a business entity usually define the next steps in the choreography of a collaborative business process. Thus, it is important that the actual business document content and resulting business entity states are unambiguously defined in a global choreography.

In the light of this \"method war\" the question arises if a unification of the existing web modeling languages can be successfully applied in the style of UML´s development. In such a unification effort we defer the task of designing a \"Unified Web Modeling Language\". Instead, we first aim at integrating three prominent representatives of the web modeling field, namely WebML, UWE, and OO-H, in order to gain a detailed understanding of their commonalities and differences as well as to identify the common concepts used in web modeling. This integration is based on specifying transformation rules allowing the transformation of WebML, UWE, and OO-H models into any other of the three languages, respectively. To this end, a major contribution of this work is the languages´ definitions made explicit in terms of metamodels, a prerequisite for model-driven web engineering for each approach.

Most of these existing approaches are metamodel-based with metamodels representing both an abstract syntax of the corresponding modeling language and also a data structure for storing models. However, this implementation specific focus makes it difficult for users of modeling languages to develop model transformations, because metamodels do not necessarily define all language concepts explicitly which are available for notation purposes. Therefore, we propose a by-example approach for defining inter-model mappings presenting semantic correspondences between concrete domain models which is more user-friendly then directly specifying model transformation rules or mappings based on the abstract syntax. The inter-model mappings between domain models can be used to generate the model transformation rules, by-example, taking into account the already defined mapping (notation) between abstract and concrete syntax elements. With this approach the user's knowledge about the notation of the modeling language is sufficient for the definition of model transformations regarding semantic correspondences. Hence, no detailed knowledge about the metamodel and the model transformation language is required.","tags":null,"title":"Towards Model Transformation Generation By-Example","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christian Huemer","Marco Zapletal"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1167609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1167609600,"objectID":"eae4a7fbfc084be594a3344dd6618e6a","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-140982/","publishdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-140982/","section":"publication","summary":"UN/CEFACT's modeling methodology (UMM) is a UML profile for modeling global B2B choreographies.

Consequently, there is an urgent need for both, academia and practice, to provide an in-depth survey, clearly identifying commonalities and differences between current AOM approaches. Existing surveys in this area focus more on comprehensibility with respect to development phases or evaluated approaches rather than on comparability at a fine-grained level.  This paper tries to fill this gap. As a prerequisite for an in-depth evaluation, a conceptual reference model is presented, capturing the basic concepts of AOM and their interrelationships in terms of a UML class diagram. Based on this conceptual reference model, an evaluation framework has been designed by deriving a detailed and well-defined catalog of evaluation criteria. The actual evaluation by means of this criteria catalog and by employing a running example is done on the basis of a carefully selected set of eight AOM approaches, each of them having already reached a certain level of maturity.

This leads to inefficient development processes, high maintenance overheads, and a low potential for reuse. We regard customization as a crosscutting concern in the sense of the aspect-oriented paradigm. As a proof of concept, we extend the prominent web modeling language WebML on basis of our reference architecture for aspect-oriented modeling. This allows for a clear separation between the core and customization functionality, and -- as a spin-off -- demonstrates how to bridge existing (domain-specific) modeling languages with aspect-oriented concepts.","tags":null,"title":"Aspect-Oriented Modeling of Ubiquitous Web Applications: The aspectWebML Approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrea Schauerhuber","Manuel Wimmer","Elisabeth Kapsammer","Wieland Schwinger","Werner Retschitzegger"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1167609600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1167609600,"objectID":"32d189e5f4e7e880904dbd83965c3b23","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-141148/","publishdate":"2007-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-141148/","section":"publication","summary":"Meta-models are a prerequisite for model-driven engineering (MDE) in general and consequently for model-driven web engineering in particular. Various web modelling languages, however, are not based on meta-models and standards, like object management group's prominent meta object facility (MOF). Instead they define proprietary languages rather focused on notational aspects. Thus, MDE techniques and tools cannot be deployed for such languages preventing to exploit the full potential of MDE in terms of standardised storage, exchange and transformation of models. The WebML web modelling language is one example that does not yet rely on an explicit meta-model in the sense of MDE. Instead, it is defined in terms of a document type definition (DTD), and implicitly within the accompanying tool. Code generation then has to rely on model-to-code transformations based of extensible stylesheet language transformations (XSLT). We propose a meta-model for WebML to bridge WebML to MDE. To establish such a meta-model, instead of remodelling WebML's meta-model from scratch, a semi-automatic approach is provided that allows generating MOF-based meta-models on the basis of DTDs. The meta-model for WebML accomplishes the following aims: first, it represents an initial step towards a transition to employ MDE techniques within the WebML design methodology. Second, the provision of a MOF-based meta-model ensures interoperability with other MDE tools.

However, these proposals also have some limitations, especially for exchanging models or representing further modeling concerns, such as architectural styles, technology independence, or distribution. A possible solution to these issues is provided by making model-driven Web Engineering proposals interoperate, being able to complement each other, and to exchange models between the different tools. MDWEnet is a recent initiative started by a small group of researchers working on model-driven Web Engineering (MDWE). Its goal is to improve current practices and tools for the model-driven development of Web applications for better interoperability. The proposal is based on the strengths of current model-driven Web Engineering methods, and the existing experience and knowledge in the field.

One of its most recent developments is UN/CEFACT´s Modeling Methodology (UMM). The UMM standard is used to model inter-organizational business processes in the B2B domain. With the increasing availability of electronic governmental services over networks, the frontier between B2B and B2G/G2G disappears. Today one expects a governmental institution to react like any other business partner. Therefore also governments now face the interoperability and compatibility issues as regular businesses do. In order to allow two governmental institutions to collaborate, a methodology uniquely depicting the inter-organizational process from a global perspective is needed. In this paper we propose to use UN/CEFACT´s Modeling Methodology in the eGovernment domain. UMM allows the definition of a global choreography which is then being used to derive local orchestrations for each business partner. Such orchestrations can then be used by enterprise applications in a service oriented context. As an example, a real-world scenario from the waste transport domain within the European Union will be shown.

Accordingly, registering one model as one object in a registry is not appropriate. Those parts of a model that may be reused must become registry objects themselves. Extracting parts of a model results in objects that are logically inter-related. Thus, a registry model taking care of these inter-relationships is needed.

The exchange of models among different modeling tools and so the integration of their modeling languages becomes an important prerequisite for effective software development processes.

Instead it is implicitly defined within the methodology´s accompanying WebRatio tool in terms of a DTD, i.e., a grammar-like textual definition for specifying the structure of XML documents. Code generation then has to rely on XSLT-based model-to-code transformations. In this paper, we propose a semi-automatic approach for generating metamodels from DTDs. We introduce a set of transformation rules and heuristics for automatically generating MOF-based metamodels from DTD definitions and suggest manual refactorings for the semantic enrichment of the metamodels. We incorporate the transformation rules and heuristics in a MetaModelGenerator (MMG) prototype implementation, and provide results on applying our approach to the WebML DTD. The benefits from our work are: (1) visualization of DTD-based languages in terms of MOF-based metamodels enhances understanding of the language, (2) employment of metamodels enables further steps towards model-driven engineering such as model transformations or language extensions through profiles, (3) tool interoperability with other MDE tools is ensured, (4) a proposal for a WebML metamodel has been generated in a semi-automatic way.","tags":null,"title":"From Document Type Definitions to Metamodels: The WebML Case Study","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Birgit Hofreiter","Christian Huemer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1136073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1136073600,"objectID":"526c18ae3cdac0b867e1fcce2cf059fd","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-203806/","publishdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-203806/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Inter-organizational Business: From a Standard Process Model to a Business Environment Specific Process","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matus Straka"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1136073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1136073600,"objectID":"0a631ee3d733c6c1a8b62300857de6e8","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-140331/","publishdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-140331/","section":"publication","summary":"In this thesis, individual steps of a pipeline for processing of the peripheral Computed Tomography Angiography (CTA) datasets are addressed. The peripheral CTA datasets are volumetric datasets representing pathologies in vascularity of the lower extremities in the human body. These pathologies result from various atherosclerotic diseases as e.g. the Peripheral Arterial Occlusive Disease (PAOD) and their early and precise diagnostics significantly contributes to planning of a later interventional radiology treatment.  The diagnostics is based on visualization of the imaged vascular tree, where individual pathologic changes, as plaque, calcifications, stenoses of the vessel lumen and occluded parts of the vessels are visible. CTA has evolved within the recent years into a robust, accurate and cost effective imaging technique for patients with both coronary and arterial diseases. As a result of the CTA scanning, a set of 1200-2000 transverse slices is acquired, depicting vessels enhanced by means of an intravenously injected contrast medium. The number of slices is high and therefore their manual examination is laborious and lengthy. As a remedy, post-processing methods were developed to allow faster and more intuitive visualization of the imaged vascularity. However, simple visualization by means of the traditional techniques as maximum-intensity projection (MIP) or direct volume rendering (DVR) is hampered due to the presence of bones in the dataset, which occlude the vessels. Therefore, a sequence of operations-the processing pipeline-is needed, leading to generation of clinically relevant images which depict unobstructed vessels.  In the first step of the pipeline the dataset is segmented and the tissues are classified, to allow subsequent vessel identification and bone removal. This is a complex task because of high density and spatial variability of the tissues. Traditional image processing techniques do not deliver acceptable results and therefore in the thesis we present new approaches that introduce additional ´anatomic´ information into the segmentation and classification process. We propose a probabilistic atlas which enables modeling of spatial and density distributions of vessel and bone tissues in datasets, to allow their improved classification. In the atlas construction the non-rigid thin-plate spline warping and registration of the datasets are applied, to address the high anatomic variability among the patients. The concept of the atlas is further extended by means of the watershed transform, to further improve precision of the registration procedure. Alternatively, we propose and evaluate a technique for vessel enhancement based on Hessian filtering to allow detection and recognition of vessel structures without operator supervision.  In the second step a geometric model of the vessel tree is constructed to derive information about the vessel centerlines. Here, an already available algorithm based on the so-called vessel-tracking, implemented by means of optimal path searching, is exploited with improvements to make the geometric model more precise.  The third step of the processing pipeline-visualization-requires this model, since its results can be significantly influenced by a potential imperfections, bringing in clinically misleading images. To address limitations of the vessel visualization by means of the existing techniques as MIP, CPR or DVR we propose their generalization in form of a focus \u0026 context-based concept called VesselGlyph. VesselGlyph enables to combine intuitively and systematically various visualization techniques to single a image to allow better, more comprehensive and unoccluded view of vessels for the diagnostic purposes.  To support the design and development of the proposed segmentation, modeling and visualization algorithms and to enable their application in the clinical environment, we implemented a set of tools grouped in the AngioVis ToolBox software. Within this application, individual steps of the processing pipeline are accomplished. The toolbox is complemented with additional utilities constituting together a fully-functional medical workstation software which is regularly used to process patient data on a daily basis in the clinical environment.","tags":null,"title":"Processing and Visualization of Peripheral CT-Angiography Datasets","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Gertrude Kappel","Beate List","Ulrike Pastner"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1136073600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1136073600,"objectID":"5b97f124e7424704facc160a7743942a","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-140595/","publishdate":"2006-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-140595/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Wissenschafterinnenkolleg Internettechnologien (WIT) - Rollenmodell für Frauenförderung an Universitäten?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Manuel Wimmer","Gerhard Kramler"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1128297600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1128297600,"objectID":"cb0d502b0698414224024d38071873a1","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-139868/","publishdate":"2005-10-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-139868/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Bridging Grammarware and Modelware","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marion Murzek","Gertrude Kappel","Gerhard Kramler"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1128297600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1128297600,"objectID":"2d8349991ce5e3f15ca95099afaf02c6","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-139843/","publishdate":"2005-10-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-139843/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Model Transformation in Practice Using the BOC Model Transformer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Harald Kühn","Marion Murzek"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1128297600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1128297600,"objectID":"f04da8a021ce4ed73d4c3e48cddda4bd","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-139846/","publishdate":"2005-10-03T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-139846/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Modelling: From Craftsmanship to Automation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Florian Humplik","Peter Leitner","Wolfgang Zuser","Thomas Grechenig"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1127433600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1127433600,"objectID":"3c0b92a1e4904044110a09b995590495","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-139698/","publishdate":"2005-09-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-139698/","section":"publication","summary":"This paper presents a pattern language with the objective to design, implement and maintain interdependent IT-systems from different vendors in the business context (so called ERP-Landscapes). They share the need to cope with heterogeneity. Heterogeneity in ERP-Landscapes has been induced by the ongoing specialization of applications in the business context (applications specializing in diverse fields like personal accounting, legal consolidation, inventory management, cost accounting and controlling). Sooner or later every business application has to interface with the input or output of other applications. From that moment you have to deal with the problems associated with an ERP-Landscape. Considering such a setting at design time will improve the adaptability of your applications. This paper characterizes different issues, which have to be considered when developing business applications in the context of an ERP-Landscape. The pattern language reflects a holistic approach showing the need to integrate both business and IT domain knowledge.

MDA is seen as the next step in the formalizing and abstraction process of software, like the replacement of assembler by high-level languages. If we believe in the promises of the OMG, then full working applications for different software platforms (e.g. J2EE, .NET, CORBA) can be automatically generated from platform independent models.  The OMG defines a theoretical architecture and specification of MDA, but the implementations of tools and transformation rules are transferred to the software industry. Tool manufacturers should develop MDA tools, which support model transformations and further aid for the successful employment of MDA in practical software development.  In practice several projects were already realized with MDA support on basis of already existing tools. The vision of the OMG is that applications are automatically generated from models. Here it has to be clarified whether the tools really implement MDA concepts or whether they are no more than UML tools, which can derive code segments automatically from graphical models.  This diploma thesis describes in detail the theoretical concepts of MDA as well as the practical MDA aspects on the basis of the CALENDARIUM project. The theoretical concepts like platform independent models, platform dependent models, model transformations and metamodels are explained. On the one hand problems of the transformation of the different models are pointed out and on the other hand effects on the software development process are discussed. Further the manual definition of transformation rules is explained.  On the basis of a list of criteria requirements for MDA tools are collected and existing tools are examined. On the basis of the CALENDARIUM project an example MDA project, which uses a relational database, Servlets, JSPs and EJBs, is constructed. In this case study a MDA tool is used for the production of an executable application from a platform independent model.  This case study demonstrates, to what extent MDA tools can perform the task automatically, or on which places the programmer still has to do manual programming. Further the current state of the art of MDA tools is pointed out by the tool evaluation. On the one hand areas are identified, which are already supported by current MDA tools, and on the other hand it is shown, which areas are covered insufficiently and still need further research activities.","tags":null,"title":"Model Driven Architecture in der Praxis - Evaluierung von aktuellen Werkzeugen und Fallstudie","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Manuel Wimmer","Gerhard Kramler"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1104537600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1104537600,"objectID":"d595811c2ffffe2155b034094274dcc4","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-174023/","publishdate":"2005-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-174023/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Modellgetriebene Softwareentwicklung in der Praxis","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Christian Huemer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1104537600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1104537600,"objectID":"202e4accd431a34c11aeb181c5126d4c","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-203817/","publishdate":"2005-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-203817/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Registering a Business Collaboration Model in Multiple Business Environments","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Marion Murzek","Gerhard Kramler"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1101945600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1101945600,"objectID":"efcd3f8748e46831f8ed042adef1aef9","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-139041/","publishdate":"2004-12-02T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-139041/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Defining Model Transformations for Business Process Models Graphically","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Harald Kühn","Marion Murzek","Franz Bayer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1098835200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1098835200,"objectID":"0cd139f0496e450524f86afc1ded91ce","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-138659/","publishdate":"2004-10-27T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-138659/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Business Model Interoperability using Enterprise Model Integration","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexandra LaCruz","Matus Straka","A Köchl","Milos Sramek","Eduard Gröller","Dominik Fleischmann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1097366400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1097366400,"objectID":"adfb26ec64524bdddbc23f3f2c6d64ee","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-138857/","publishdate":"2004-10-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-138857/","section":"publication","summary":"Accurate estimation of vessel parameters is a prerequisite for automated visualization and analysis of normal and diseased blood vessels. The objective of this research is to estimate the dimensions of lower extremity arteries, imaged by computed tomography (CT). The vessel is modeled using an elliptical or cylindrical structure with specific dimensions, orientation and blood vessel mean density. The model separates two homogeneous regions: Its inner side represents a region of density for vessels, and its outer side a region for background. Taking into account the point spread function (PSF) of a CT scanner, a function is modeled with a Gaussian kernel, in order to smooth the vessel boundary in the model. A new strategy for vessel parameter estimation is presented. It stems from vessel model and model parameter optimization by a nonlinear optimization procedure (the Levenberg-Marquardt technique). The method provides center location, diameter and orientation of the vessel as well as blood and background mean density values. The method is tested on synthetic data and real patient data with encouraging results.","tags":null,"title":"Non-linear Model Fitting to Parameterize Diseased Blood Vessels","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Matus Straka","Michal Cervenanský","Alexandra LaCruz","A Köchl","Milos Sramek","Eduard Gröller","Dominik Fleischmann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1097366400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1097366400,"objectID":"38771ab84aaff985a22219fbeae5dd65","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-138876/","publishdate":"2004-10-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-138876/","section":"publication","summary":"Reliable and complete blood-vessel segmentation is still a challenging problem. This is especially true in the presence of morphologic changes resulting from atherosclerotic diseases. In this paper we take advantage of partially segmented data with approximately identified vessel centerlines to comprehensively visualize the diseased peripheral arterial tree. We introduce the VesselGlyph as an abstract notation for novel focus \u0026 context visualization techniques of tubular structures such as contrast-medium enhanced arteries in CT-Angiography (CT-A). The proposed techniques combine direct volume rendering (DVR) and curved planar reformation (CPR) within a single image. The VesselGlyph consists of several regions where different rendering methods are used. Region type, the used visualization method and region parameters depend on the distance from the vessel centerline and on viewing parameters as well. By selecting proper rendering techniques for different regions, vessels are depicted in a naturally looking and undistorted anatomic context. In this paper we furthermore present a way how to implement the proposed techniques in software and by means of modern 3D graphics accelerators.","tags":null,"title":"The VesselGlyph: Focus \u0026 Context Visualization in CT-Angiography","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wolfgang Zuser","Thomas Grechenig"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1095638400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1095638400,"objectID":"f87b168f2b1e4c543be93deaaa44d76b","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-138882/","publishdate":"2004-09-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-138882/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A Web Based Feedback Tool for Software Engineering Teams","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thomas Grechenig","Wolfgang Zuser"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1094601600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1094601600,"objectID":"1df49bb2c73b3712ce8caef687393047","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-138881/","publishdate":"2004-09-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-138881/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Creating Organic Software Maturity Attitudes (COSMA)","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wolfgang Zuser","Thomas Grechenig"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1087776000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1087776000,"objectID":"f71dfb4b4ca7cdc3ccdbbe1f00135a61","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-138883/","publishdate":"2004-06-21T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-138883/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Four personality traits make a software engineer","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thomas Grechenig","Wolfgang Zuser"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1085270400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1085270400,"objectID":"c8715e33fa47dcdf78162d738f97f12e","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-138885/","publishdate":"2004-05-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-138885/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"How to find a Pragmatic Personality Model On Members in a Software Engineering Teams","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wolfgang Zuser","Thomas Grechenig","Armin Scherz"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1085270400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1085270400,"objectID":"3f8a19fd41e157121d74a00187c8890c","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-138879/","publishdate":"2004-05-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-138879/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Selected Principles and Activities for Software Maturity in small and medium Software Enterprises","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Thomas Költringer","Thomas Grechenig"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1082764800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1082764800,"objectID":"a20321ac2247d7423fa4554d08f5f0d7","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-138886/","publishdate":"2004-04-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-138886/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Comparing the Immediate Usability of Graffiti 2 and Virtual Keyboard","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Wolfgang Zuser","Thomas Grechenig","Armin Scherz","Martin Tomitsch"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1072915200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1072915200,"objectID":"6b9930c320a6597f9810dc8ba790792e","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-138884/","publishdate":"2004-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-138884/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"A pattern language for software quality assurance in small and medium enterprises - the action patterns","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alexandra LaCruz","Matus Straka","A Köchl","Milos Sramek","Eduard Gröller","Dominik Fleischmann"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1072915200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1072915200,"objectID":"4fc14b061a219a57a032e56f02dd799a","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-138878/","publishdate":"2004-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-138878/","section":"publication","summary":"Purpose: The accurate determination of the central vessel axis is a prerequisite for automated visualization (curved planar reformation) and quantitation. The purpose of this work was to assess the accuracy of different algorithms for automated centerline detection in a phantom simulating the peripheral arterial tree. Methods and Material: Six algorithms were used to determine the centerline of a synthetic peripheral arterial vessel (aorto-to-pedal arteries, diameter 18-0.6mm) dataset (256x256x600, voxel size 0.5x0.5x0.5mm). They are ray-casting/thresholding (RCT), ray-casting/maximum gradient (RCMG), block matching (BM), fitting to ellipse (FE), center of gravity (CoG), and Randomized Hough transform (RHT). Gaussian noise whith a sigma: 0, 5 and 10 was used to observe the accuracy of the method under noise influence The accuracy of automatic centerline determination was quantified by measuring the error-distance between the derived centerlines, and the known centerline course of the synthetic dataset. Results: BM demonstrated unacceptable performance in large vessels (5mm) when the shift used was less than 3 voxels. RCMG demonstrated a greater error (mean of the error 4.73mm) in large diameter (15mm) vessels than in small diameter (","tags":null,"title":"Accuracy of Automated Centerline Approximation Algorithms for Lower Extremity Vessels in CTA Phantom","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Birgit Hofreiter","Klaus-Dieter Naujok","Christian Huemer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1072915200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1072915200,"objectID":"3b2dbe0ab8e13d51bc8ea55d1c7c77fd","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-203835/","publishdate":"2004-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-203835/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Business Collaboration Framework: Interoperability on Top of Web Services","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Galina Paskaleva"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1072915200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1072915200,"objectID":"a1bf7666bcbc2989e733c8ad646b3443","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-153874/","publishdate":"2004-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-153874/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Der aktive Raum","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Birgit Hofreiter","Christian Huemer"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1072915200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1072915200,"objectID":"860464da3e5d034407183a188e1cb9f5","permalink":"https://big.tuwien.ac.at/publication/tuw-203823/","publishdate":"2004-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/tuw-203823/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"ebXML Business Processes - Defined both in UMM and BPSS","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Birgit Hofreiter","Christian Huemer","W.

Meeting these rapidly evolving requirements in regard to size of code per engine control as well as to the variety and diversity of control tasks made software engineering methodology play an important role in the management agenda. Improvements have become necessary in the areas of project management, requirement management, software design, configuration management, and software quality assurance. Today a higher level of software quality, rather well defined processes, and a higher level of accuracy of delivery schedules have been achieved by consciously taking ongoing SE improvement steps.
