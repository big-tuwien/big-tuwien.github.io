&lt;p>The manufacturing processes of the future need to be highly flexible and dynamic in order to satisfy customer demands for, e.g., large series production, mass customization, or changing orders. The organisations are also changing and manufacturing companies are not only part of sequential, long-term supply chains, but also part of (potentially) extensive manufacturing networks which require agile collaboration between partners. Companies involved in such networks need to be able to design, configure, execute, and monitor a very large number of manufacturing process instances, each representing a different order and supply chain instance. One way to achieve this is the establishment of virtual factories through a middleware platform.&lt;br>
Finding the right business partners to carry out manufacturing processes is naturally a prerequisite for this. Apart from costs, other factors like trust, reliability and availability play a role during the formation of dynamic production networks – both during design time and runtime of such a network. Hence, in this project, the formation of dynamic production networks will be supported both on the conceptual as well as on the technical level.&lt;/p>

In a vertical integration scenario, IT systems of different vendors might be in use and proprietary interfaces need to defined in order to allow the exchange of relevant information from one system to another. A model-driven approach for vertical integration of IT systems is proposed in this work. It is based on the application of industry standards for the representation of hierarchy level specific system properties and an alignment of their key concepts in order to provide bridging functions (transformations) for the conversion of data between the different systems.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Leveraging Semantic Web Technologies in Configuration Management</title><link>https://big.tuwien.ac.at/phd-thesis/leveraging-semantic-web-technologies-in-configuration-management/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 May 2020 12:38:10 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://big.tuwien.ac.at/phd-thesis/leveraging-semantic-web-technologies-in-configuration-management/</guid><description>&lt;p>Although the concept of Semantic Web and Semantic Web technologies (SWT) in particular have been investigated over several years now, they were mainly seen as an interesting research topic having its application domain primarily in the World Wide Web (WWW) rather than be matured enough to be used within a productive environment that might have no direct relation to the WWW at all. With recent developments in the area of Web 3.0 (the Web of Data) including the emerging trends of Big Data and Linked (Open/Closed) Data, SWTs have proven to be able to process and consume large amounts of data, whilst at the same time offering extended reasoning capabilities. Configuration management (CM) on the contrary, deals with software systems in complex technological environments and faces highly complex challenges, such as (i) configuring and incorporating heterogeneous components into complete systems, or (ii) providing elaborated change management for such components. To tackle those challenges, sophisticated solution approaches which utilize available semantic information about components, systems, and the relationships among them are required. The aim of the proposed dissertation is to leverage the use of Semantic Web technologies in configuration management, i.e. address the identified challenges of CM by offering elaborated solutions based on Semantic Web technologies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Concurrent Multi-Viewpoint Building Information modeling (COMBINE)</title><link>https://big.tuwien.ac.at/phd-thesis/concurrent-multi-viewpoint-building-information-modeling-combine/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 May 2020 12:38:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://big.tuwien.ac.at/phd-thesis/concurrent-multi-viewpoint-building-information-modeling-combine/</guid><description>&lt;p>The processes in the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) and Facility Management (FM) industries are iterative – components are created, revised or discarded. There are many stakeholders with a multitude of domain-specific requirements and tools – for calculation, information visualisation and exchange, using a variety of standards (e.g. DXF, STEP, IFC, COLLADA, XML, etc.). This makes efficient and timely communication critical. The project COMBINE explores some of its requirements, such as selectivity in the communication, domain-specific adaptation to changes as well as monitoring and versioning, with a particular focus on the loss- and corruption-free translation between standards. The challenges this translation has to address are, among others, the rapid development of new technologies and the relatively slow adaptation of the relevant standards, the varying and disparate levels of detail across standards, and the lack of common ontological platform. The project COMIBINE aims to apply the tools of multilevel model driven development in the search for ontological similarities between standards on various meta-levels. It examines the methods of extracting semantics not only from the formal specification but also from the artefacts of a standard. Finally, it examines visualization techniques that enable the understanding and development of complex multilevel modelling hierarchies.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Model-Driven Language Modernization</title><link>https://big.tuwien.ac.at/phd-thesis/model-driven-language-modernization/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 May 2020 12:38:09 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://big.tuwien.ac.at/phd-thesis/model-driven-language-modernization/</guid><description>&lt;p>The introduction of Extensible Markup Language (XML) represented a tremendous leap towards the design of Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs). Although XML-based languages are well adopted and flexible, their generic editors miss modern DSL editor functionality. Additionally, artifacts defined with such languages lack comprehensibility and, therefore, maintainability, because XML has primarily been designed as a machine-processable format with immutable concrete syntax. While there exist techniques to migrate XML-based languages to modeling languages, they are composed of manual steps demanding complex language engineering skills that are usually not part of a domain engineer’s skill set. To tackle these shortcomings, we propose a bridge between XML-based languages and text-based modeling languages. This includes the automated and customizable generation of Xtext-based editors from XML schema definitions (XSDs) providing advanced editor functionality, individualized textual concrete syntax style, and round-trip transformations enabling the exchange of data between the two languages. For the evaluation of the approach, we plan to conduct case studies as well as user studies based on industrial-strength markup languages that will be transformed to textual modeling languages including editors that are intended to be at least as powerful as those manually built for XML-based languages.&lt;/p>

In order to meet these requirements, these processes tend to rely on Model-Driven-Software development. With growing industrial digitization (Industry 4.0), interfaces between people and network plants are gaining substantial importance. Much is demanded of these HMIs such as intuitivity, ease of use, simplicity and at the same time providing a wealth of information at the right moment to users and allowing fast interaction with other interfaces. Typically, the development of Model-Driven software and development of associated Human-Machine-Interface (HMI) are separated from one another. The HMIs are either developed manually, domain-specific for the application and the underlying model or SCADA/HMI tools are used to generate these HMIs. Although many elements of the model and HMI go hand in hand and much of the model is mapped directly in the HMI, these are developed separately. These circumstances lead to a more complex development and require longer planning phases and therefore increase the costs. In the course on this thesis, a tool supported research will be conducted to provide a basis to easily generate HMIs for any model. AutomationML will be used as an example for demonstration purposes. The aim is to reduce the additional development effort and cost, resulting from the domain-specific separated development of the HMIs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Using Model-based Testing Approaches for Creating Behaviour-driven Tests in the Context of VoIP Software</title><link>https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/using-model-based-testing-approaches-for-creating-behaviour-driven-tests-in-the-context-of-voip-software/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 May 2020 12:37:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/using-model-based-testing-approaches-for-creating-behaviour-driven-tests-in-the-context-of-voip-software/</guid><description/></item><item><title>A Framework for Execution-based Model Profiling</title><link>https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/a-framework-for-execution-based-model-profiling/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 May 2020 12:37:20 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/a-framework-for-execution-based-model-profiling/</guid><description>&lt;p>In Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) models are used throughout the software development process in prescriptive ways. Such prescriptive models are important during the implementation phase of software and systems. In addition, there are descriptive models generated from runtime data offering valuable information in one of the later phases of a system’s life cycle. Unfortunately, descriptive models are only marginally explored in the field of MDE. Current MDE approaches mostly neglect the possibility to combine prescriptive and descriptive models in a unifying framework to link downstream and upstream information. To bridge this gap, we propose such a framework by loosely couple MDE approaches with process mining (PM) techniques. This framework enables us to support execution-based model profiling as continuous monitoring process over the entire life cycle of a system. In the course of this thesis, we provide an evaluation case study in order to demonstrate the feasibility and benefits of the introduced approach. For this purpose we implement a prototype of our framework, which registers logs from a running traffic light system. This system is modeled both, in a basic and extended object-oriented way. The prototype transforms the registered logs of systems into XES-format in order to apply established PM algorithms (e.g., inductive miner). Further, we evaluate different PM algorithms (e.g., α-algorithm, inductive miner) to determine the most efficient one for our approach.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Integration and Evaluation of Planning Solvers in Production Environments.

With the help of specialized modeling tools developers are able to create and edit models based on their graphical representation. Traditional graphical modeling editors are powerful, heavy weight desktop applications that are strongly tailored towards a particular language and built on top of existing modeling frameworks like the Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF). This causes major limitations in terms of re-usability and extensibility. It’s often not possible to develop a graphical language that is supported by multiple modeling tools without major modi cations and the anguage has to be integrated into each platform/tool separately. Another aspect that has to be considered is the rise of web technologies, and in particular cloud based concepts, that can be observed over the last couple of years. This trend causes a shift in Model-Driven Engineering resulting in an increased interest to migrate existing model editing tools to the web. The motivations driving this shift are twofold: increased usability through the usage of modern UI technology, such as TML5 and CSS, and simpli ed deploy ability via a browser. In addition, this enables new opportunities like cloud-based collaborative modeling tools but at the same time opens new challenges and potential problems. Web-based solutions require a decoupled architecture composed of dedicated client and server artifacts. However due to their monolithic nature current state of the art modeling tools are not suitable for distributed deployment. The development of full- edged graphical modeling tools is a challenging and complex task [15] so re-implementing them on a web-based technology stack is often not feasible. Instead a proper approach to develop and maintain modern web modeling tools whilst reusing well established modeling platforms has to be found.&lt;br>
These problems are not only limited to the context of graphical languages but are also applicable to other language development areas. Looking at textual programming languages similar issues have been concluded and led to the creation of&lt;br>
the Language Server Protocol (LSP). This eort eectively decouples textual language IDE development into a client-server architecture. The client is generic and language-agnostic which means an LSP client can (potentially) connect to&lt;br>
any number of language-speci c servers via standardized protocol. Following a similar path for graphical languages seems logical but it’s currently not clear how to properly achieve this. Technically LSP provides a powerful extension mechanism which would allow the implementation of a graphical language server protocol on top of LSP. In practice this approach has some major downsides and might even be insucient to cover all common use cases. In order&lt;br>
to use LSP each graphical language would have to conform to a textual language. Since not all potential graphical languages are or even can be derived from textual artifacts another solution might be preferable.&lt;br>
It also has to be considered that the concept of completely language-agnostic clients might not be applicable in this context. Graphical language clients need a lot additional information to properly identify model elements, render their&lt;br>
graphical representation and to be able to trigger model modi cations.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Web of Needs in an Environment of Heterogeneous ERP Systems</title><link>https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/web-of-needs-in-an-environment-of-heterogeneous-erp-systems/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 May 2020 12:37:19 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/web-of-needs-in-an-environment-of-heterogeneous-erp-systems/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Detection of inconsistencies between software models and executing software at runtime</title><link>https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/detection-of-inconsistencies-between-software-models-and-executing-software-at-runtime/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 May 2020 12:37:18 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/detection-of-inconsistencies-between-software-models-and-executing-software-at-runtime/</guid><description>&lt;p>Emerging technologies such as self-adaptive software, Internet of Things (IoT) and Distributed Systems (DS) as well as an increasing scalability of software systems complicate predicting whether a software system will behave as expected based on verification of its static properties or not. Additionally, software providers tend to reduce their release cycles due to increasing volatility of requirements in an agile software development environment. This makes extensive testing of software more and more difficult. Verification is usually based merely on automated tests that mostly neglect the runtime behavior of a system. This might lead to impactful problems in various areas. For instance, imagine driving an “autonomous car”. This car is connected to various external systems, or even other cars, that might determine decisions it takes while driving to defined locations. It is relevant for occupants whether the system behaves as expected. Or imagine living in a so-called “Smart Home”. It is important that the connected distributed devices in the system behave only as intended by the owner. In addition, this should be verifiable.&lt;br>
In my master thesis, I want to focus on creating a framework that automates the verification of runtime behavior of a software system. Therefore, it compares UML sequence diagrams created from runtime log traces with existing diagrams that represent the current state of requirements of the system. Additionally, I want to create generic methods for specific tasks in implementing such a framework (like loading models or classifying inconsistencies) that can be reused to facilitate further research in this area.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Development of a Graphical DSL for Manufacturing Environments.

To address this problem Daimler initiated in cooperation with the universities of Magdeburg and Karlsruhe the development of the data-exchange language AutomationML (AML). AML is a standardized neutral, free to use, XML based data exchange format which uses Computer Aided Engineering eXchange (CAEX) as its top-level format. The usage of CAEX is further refined within AML. Due to the restrictions and extensions in the AML specification a valid standard CAEX structure is not necessarily a valid AML CAEX structure. Therefore, validity checks available for standard CAEX are not sufficient for AML CAEX structures. Beside validity to the formal definition of AML another vital aspect for model quality is the definition and assessment of modelling guidelines and software-metrics, which is already widely used in classical software development. Therefore the overall aim of this thesis is to create a validation and assessment framework for AML CAEX models. The framework on the one hand provides a formal way to validate AML CAEX models not only on the CAEX but also on the refined AML CAEX definitions. On the other hand the framework creates a possibility to assess a model based on modelling guidelines and model-metrics (e.g., naming conventions, maximal model depth, etc).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Managing Concurrent Heterogeneous Editing in Web-Based Modeling Tools</title><link>https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/managing-concurrent-heterogeneous-editing-in-web-based-modeling-tools/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 May 2020 12:37:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/managing-concurrent-heterogeneous-editing-in-web-based-modeling-tools/</guid><description>&lt;p>Graphical modeling languages are one of the most common approaches for model driven software engineering. Traditional graphic modeling tools like Eclipse Sirius are usually powerful monolithic desktop applications, yet built on top of rather outdated technologies, such as GEF3, GMF and SWT. As the overall trend in software engineering goes towards extensibility, portability and re-usability, it also led to big movement in model driven software engineering. There is high interest in a transition from monolithic modeling tools to web-based solutions. The usage of quickly evovling web technologies such as HTML5 promises to increase usability, accessibility, future-proofness and make use of distributed deployment options. With the implementation of the Graphical Language Server Protocol and the GLSP Framework a big step towards a modern web-based solution for web-based graphical modeling was already taken. The implemented GLSP framework is on the client-side based on the open source frameworks Eclipse Sprotty and creates with the extensible open source platform Theia a desktop-IDE-like client. By applying the architectural pattern of the Language Server Protocol it forms a client-server protocol framework for graphical modeling languages and, as a consequence, may provide the same exibility and decoupling of the modeling language implementation from the actual modeling tool platform.&lt;br>
The main purpose of graphical modeling editors lies in visual representations and different editing possibilities of the underlying model.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Model-based Systems Engineering with Piping &amp; Instrumentation Diagrams</title><link>https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/model-based-systems-engineering-with-piping-instrumentation-diagrams/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 May 2020 12:37:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/model-based-systems-engineering-with-piping-instrumentation-diagrams/</guid><description>&lt;p>Piping &amp;amp; Instrumentation Diagrams (P&amp;amp;ID) are derivations of process flow diagrams and are used to provide a schematic representation of plants with respect to the system description, system flow and control logic. The bulk of toolsets supporting process modeling for technical process plants developed from special purpose orientated needs in the industry. The key research topic of this thesis is to elaborate an approach to reuse or extend the concepts of well known general purpose modeling languages (SysML) in the field of software- and systems-engineering to provide a more sophisticated modeling method for P&amp;amp;IDs. The first aim and prerequisite for further research is to analyze the key concepts and characteristics of graphical notations in the domain of Piping &amp;amp; Instrumentation. A proper mapping from equipment, connectives and constraints in P&amp;amp;IDs to the meta-model of SysML should be found. Furthermore all aspects of incompatibility and workarounds concerning the mapping to an abstract model should be part of this result. The next part involves an UML Profile implementation of P&amp;amp;IDs in Enterprise Architect (EA). EA is being developed by Sparx Systems and is a so-called End-to-End Modeling Tool. The outcome should be an elementary support of graphical concrete syntax (creation of diagrams) of P&amp;amp;IDs, consisting of graphical symbols, connectives and compositional rules by implementing a plugin for EA. Based on the implementation of P&amp;amp;ID as an UML-Profile in EA, it comes do determine the advantages and new perspectives due to the representation of Piping &amp;amp; Instrumentations systems as an concrete model in SysUML with respect to the capabilities of EA.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>An experimental library for functional reactive variables</title><link>https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/an-experimental-library-for-functional-reactive-variables/</link><pubDate>Tue, 19 May 2020 12:37:15 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://big.tuwien.ac.at/master-thesis/an-experimental-library-for-functional-reactive-variables/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>
